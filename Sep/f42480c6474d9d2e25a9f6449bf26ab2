Sola Shittu Benin At least three persons have been reportedly killed by hoodlums in an attack on Iguadolor community in the Ovia South West local Government Area of the state. The victims are a mother, a girl and a six months old baby. It was gathered that the victims were children and grandchildren of the Odionwere (head) of the village, Pa. Omorogbe Avanrenren. Eyewitness account said the killings might be unconnected with the lingering crisis between the community elders and Okaighele (youth head) of the community, Perrick Egbon. Pa Avanreren said he was shocked that his children were attacked and killed by the hoodlums. Chairman of Ovia South West LGA, Scot Ogbemudia, who visited the community appealed for calm and promised to unravel the killers. “We will make sure we investigate this incident. We will work with security agencies and ensure the law takes its course,” he said. Egbon, in a phone interview with our correspondent, denied his involvement in the killings. He described it as an unsubstantiated allegation. Spokesman for the Edo Police Command, DSP Chidi Nwabuzor, confirmed the killings but said no arrest had been made. He said, “It actually happened. Three persons were killed; two female adults and a baby. The police are currently investigating the incident.” Copyright PUNCH.
