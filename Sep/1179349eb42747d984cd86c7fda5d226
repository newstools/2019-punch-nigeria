Sola Shittu Benin Edo state governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, on Tuesday said that 12 Microfinance Banks in the state had benefited from the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund. Addressing MFB operators at a one day sensitisation workshop organised by the National Association of Microfinance Banks, Edo State chapter, Obaseki said available records also showed that over 13,000 MSMEs had benefited from the fund. The governor who spoke through the state commissioner for wealth creation, cooperative and employment, Mr Felix Akhabue, said that the N2bn MSMEDF had already been completely settled by the Edo State government with the Central Bank of Nigeria. He said, “In line with CBN guidelines for the fund, over 60 per cent beneficiaries are female and this has greatly improved household income of Edo citizens. “Besides, beneficiaries are from the 18 local government areas of the state and cut across all the sectors of the state economy.” The governor said that there was no gainsaying the fact that the success of any loan scheme depended on the rate of repayment. He added that if loans were recovered, more citizens would benefit and thus better their businesses. Copyright PUNCH.
