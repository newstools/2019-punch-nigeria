Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government said on Tuesday that construction activities on roads and other infrastructure across the country were being slowed down by rains. It also announced that the first set of weigh bridges would be rolled out nationwide to protect Nigerian roads by guarding against excess cargo weights. The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, disclosed this when he received board members of the Federal Road Maintenance Agency, led by the agency’s Chairman, Babatunde Lemo. Fashola urged the FERMA board to pay more attention to the protection of roads while carrying out maintenance works on them. He also warned road users against damaging Nigerian roads through overloading. The minister stated that once the weigh bridges were in place, excess loads would be offloaded and owners surcharged. According to him, the country was at the peak of the rainy season where the roads were prone to damages. Fashola explained that the consequences of bad weather were harmful to every country’s infrastructure architecture, leaving behind devastating effects. He, however, assured road users that the government was aware of the challenges and was responding to them, and noted that the rains had slowed down activities in the construction sector generally. The minister urged FERMA to collaborate more with federal controllers of works in states to improve the quality of Nigerian roads, as he promised to empower the controllers to take ownership and full responsibility of the ministry’s strategy of road protection to secure lives and properties.
