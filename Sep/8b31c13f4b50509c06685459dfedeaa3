Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Nigerian Army said on Thursday that it was coordinating with the Multi-National Joint Task Force comprising Cameroon, Niger Republic and Chad to bombard the strongholds of Boko Haram and Islamic State West African Province fighters in the North-East, particularly in the Lake Chad region. The army noted that the “continued shelling, bombardment and pursuits” of the terrorists had forced them to move en masse towards Sudan and the Central African Republic. The acting Director, Army Public Relations, Col Sagir Musa, said in a release, that the military had observed a massive exodus of the insurgents from the Lake Chad Tumbus to the North and Central Africa sub-regions. Musa said the military bombardments in the North-East would be intensified. He said, “Due to the combined onslaught on the identified hideouts of the Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters by our troops and the MNJTF, at the fringes of Lake Chad region, there is an observed massive exodus of the criminals out of Lake Chad Tumbus to North and Central Africa sub-regions. “There are credible reports indicating massive movements of the criminal groups out of the area towards Sudan and Central African Republic as a result of artillery and aerial bombardments of their settlements. “This mass movement for their lives was necessitated following bombardments, which killed uncountable fighters and destroyed their weapons and equipment. “The various national troops and the MNJTF are maintaining aggressive patrols and blocking positions against infiltration by the escaping criminals.” Copyright PUNCH.
