Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta Two persons on Tuesday were crushed to death in Akinale village in the Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State by a bus conveying cartons of turkey. The bus was fleeing from men of the Nigeria Customs Service. Our correspondent gathered that the Customs officials chased the suspected smugglers along the Abeokuta-Lagos Expressway. The suspects ran over two persons, including a vulcaniser, sitting by the roadside at Akinale near Wasimi in the Ewekoro Local Government Area. Speaking with our correspondent on the killing, the Towulade of Akinale, Oba Olufemi Ogunleye, blamed the driver and the Customs men. Oba Ogunleye described one of the victims (the vulcaniser) as a very hard-working man. He said, “Today’s accident is unfortunate and regrettable. It is indiscipline by the driver and the government’s agency because the Customs ought to have nipped in the bud the question of smuggling right at the border not to be pursuing people on the main road. “They were running after these people and after the accident, they ran away, they didn’t wait.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident. Oyeyemi said, “It’s true. The Customs men were chasing the bus and it somersaulted and killed two people.” READ ALSO: AAUA students lament incessant robberies The Customs PRO in the state, Abdulahi Maiwadah, promised to get back to our correspondent as soon as he got the detail.
