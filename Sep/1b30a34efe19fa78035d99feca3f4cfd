The presence of a naked man and a suspicious package has led to the evacuation of Manchester Airport railway station on Monday. According to Daily Mail, passengers travelling to board flights were delayed and office workers ordered to leave their desks as armed police and explosives experts flooded the airport, which is to the south of the city. A naked man was seen running around a car park, waving his arms in the air before the security alert was called. Police said the man was arrested at the scene as bomb squad officers investigated the package. A controlled explosion was then carried out at 9:30 p.m. Bus driver Caroline Watson said she saw a naked man at the scene waving his arms shortly after 6:00 a.m. [READ ALSO] Sowore: Charges stain on human rights records of Buhari’s govt – Shehu Sani She said, “The guy was running around with his arms waving in the air, going up and down. “He was running back and forth.

All hell has broken loose.’ A local worker said, “There are police everywhere, lots of armed police and ambulances. There are lots of unmarked vehicles as well. “The train station is also an office building, nobody is being allowed into work. People are confused.
