ALEXANDER OKERE with agency report Governor Bello Matawalle has ordered the closure of Shattima Model Primary School, Gusau, over the desecration of the Holy Qur’an. Matawalle also sent all staff members of the school on an indefinite suspension, following the incident which was said to have occurred in the school. The school will remain shut pending full investigation by the State Basic Education Commission, according to a statement by the Director-General, Press Affairs, to the governor, Yusuf Idris, on Saturday. Pages of the Holy Qur’an were said to have been discovered around 11am on Friday in the sewage of the school at about 11am on Friday, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. It was learnt that abuses of the holy book had earlier been recorded at Danturai Primary school, the state library, Farida General Hospital and Rabi’a Jumaat Mosque, amongst others within the Gusau metropolis. However, Matawalle, who is currently in the United States to attract investors, assured that the government would fish out the perpetrators of the unholy act. “Government will deal ruthlessly with anyone with a hand in this dastardly act, however highly placed,” he said and urged residents to be more vigilant. He also ordered the immediate deployment of three additional security guards to all public primary schools in the state capital to strengthen security. Copyright PUNCH.
