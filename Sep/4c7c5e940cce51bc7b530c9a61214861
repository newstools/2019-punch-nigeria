Dayo Ojerinde The Nigerian Cardiac Society has said cardiovascular diseases are currently on the rise in the country as a result of increased cardiovascular risk factors. This was part of the communiqué released by the society at the end of its 48th Annual General Meeting and Scientific Conference held in Enugu between September 9 and 13, 2019. The communiqué, jointly signed by the President and the Assistant General Secretary of the society, Dr Okechukwu Ogah, and Prof. Augustine Odili, read, “Hypertension affects more than 30 per cent of Nigerians having been identified as the most important cardiovascular disease risk factor and the commonest cause of heart failure, which has a worse prognosis than most cancers in Nigeria. “There is an increasing prevalence of ischaemic heart disease in Nigeria with poor facilities for diagnosis and adequate treatment. “Rheumatic Heart Disease, a preventable cause of heart failure, is still common especially in the rural parts of Nigeria and access to corrective surgeries like valve replacements, is available only to a few. Good hygiene, clean environment and strong political will, will be vital to prevention.” The society lamented that cardiovascular care was not adequately financed in the country, which had contributed immensely to the burden of cardiovascular disease in Nigeria. The society called for a deliberate and increased governmental and private funding for cardiovascular care, research and training, as well as greater collaboration between the health sector and cardiovascular stakeholders.
