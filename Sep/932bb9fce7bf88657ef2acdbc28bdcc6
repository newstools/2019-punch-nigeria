Sola Shittu, Benin Fifteen months after Amanda was declared missing, her 28-year-old distraught father, Mr Edosa Osaruonamen, on Tuesday wrote a Save our Soul letter to the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, and the state Commissioner of Police, Danmallam Abubakar, to help find his daughter. Amanda and her sister, Christabel, were stolen from their father’s house at Utese village on June 4, 2018, allegedly by their tenants, Roseline and Mary. Christabel was recovered in May this year in Enugu State from one Mrs Anioke Augustine, who bought her for N800,000. Amanda was said to have been sold to one Uju (now deceased) in Asaba, Delta State, and later resold to a woman in Ogwashi-Ukwu. In the letter to the governor, Edosa said he had spent all his life savings on searching for Amanda, who was four when she was stolen. He commended the police for helping to return Christabel, but added that there was still a gap in his life. “My family is now scattered. My wife left me because of the issue. We need your support to help mobilise the police to continue investigation into the whereabouts of Amanda,” he said. Copyright PUNCH.
