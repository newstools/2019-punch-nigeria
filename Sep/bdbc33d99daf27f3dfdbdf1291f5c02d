The Lagos State Government on Wednesday frowned at the shooting of two students of Kankon Secondary School, Kankon, Badagry, and one other person by officials of the Nigeria Customs Service. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Culture and Tourism, Mr Solomon Bonu, spoke during a constituency stakeholders’ meeting organised by the Lagos State House of Assembly. According to the governor’s aide, the people of Badagry West are angry at the incident. “We want our kings to beg the customs officials, who mount checkpoints in many areas of our communities, to stop shooting our students. “They are our leaders of tomorrow; we don’t want you to maim them for us. We are not happy about the shooting, whether it is deliberate or not; they should stop it. “Also, I am using this opportunity to tell the Controller of Customs and the Divisional Police Officers that there are many checkpoints from Agbara to Seme and also from Gbaji to Owode checkpoint. “They have to look into these checkpoints and reduce their numbers. The people of Badagry are law abiding citizens,” he said. On September 3, some customs officials allegedly shot at two students of Kankon Secondary School, Kankon, Badagry, and one other person.
