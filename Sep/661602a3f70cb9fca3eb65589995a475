A paedophile, Gerald Hedges, 61, has been jailed for 26 years after he asked an undercover police officer if he could have sex with her disabled daughter, eight. Hedges targeted the girl – who had a mental age of five – after the officer posed online as a mother, telling him her child had a condition known as Type 21 Down, reports Mirror UK. A court sitting in Portsmouth Crown Court heard how he also raped two adult women almost three decades ago and sexually abused two other women when they were children. A jury heard how Hedges started talking to the officer in an online chatroom called Disabled Chat UK. When she told him she had two daughters – the eight-year-old and a baby girl – he asked if he could move in as a lodger to help pay her bills.

After the defendant was arrested, two women came forward revealing Hedges had raped them around 30 years ago and two further women claimed they had been sexually abused by him when they were children. Prosecutor Jodie Mittell said, “Hedges was particularly interested in young girls in school uniform because he would slow down [as he was driving] in the car if they were walking past.” Hedges denied the charges, insisting he had been joking in the online chat room, had never abused any young girls and the sex with the two adults was consensual. Hedges has convicted on seven charges of indecent assault, two child sex offences, and five rape charges after a trial in July. Judge Timothy Mousley QC said Hedges ‘lacked the courage to admit what he did’ and jailed him for 26 years.
