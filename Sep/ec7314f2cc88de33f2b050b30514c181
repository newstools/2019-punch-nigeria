Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta The Department of Petroleum Resources, Abeokuta, Ogun State field office, on Thursday told illegal cooking gas skid operators in the state to either regularise their operations or risk being shut down and prosecuted. The Controller of Operations, Mrs Muinat Bello-Zagi, gave the warning during a meeting with the Cooking Gas Skid Proprietors Association of Nigeria, Ogun State chapter in Abeokuta. Bello-Zagi said although the aspiration of the Federal Government was to increase the domestic usage of cooking gas within the country, the DPR would not compromise safety. “We have been clamping down on them (illegal gas skid operators) and we will continue to seal them if they continue to operate in an unsafe manner. “The concern is the spacing requirement, all of them did not meet it and we said the spacing requirement is necessary because it will help to avert danger if there is leakage of gas.” Copyright PUNCH.
