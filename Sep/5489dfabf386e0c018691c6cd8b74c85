Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja A coalition of civil society groups on Tuesday continued its protest to the British High Commission and the Embassy of Ireland in Abuja over the award of a $9.6bn fine against Nigeria by a United Kingdom court. Addressing the protesters at their resumed occupation of the embassies on Tuesday, the President of the group, Etuk Williams, said that the British and Irish governments had been given 21-day ultimatum to call Process & Industrial Developments Limited to order. They carried various placards with inscription such “$9.6bn judgement is a fraud,” “No to illegal takeover of our national assets,” “Nigeria rejects fraudulent judgment from British judge,” among others. He described the judgment as a travesty of justice and disrespect to the Nigerian government. He said while the group respects the responsibility of the courts, it frowns at the steps taken by the company and the tribunal in the UK towards the dispute involving Nigerian government and P&ID. Williams said, “We are giving the British and Irish governments 21-day ultimatum to act and call the UK court and P&ID to order. “If after 21 days and nothing happens; we will come back and occupy the embassies. We will sleep here, cook here and eat here until the judgment is reversed.” The group stated that it embarked on the protests to send a strong message to the international community that Nigeria was not a lawless country. He added, “Nigeria is not a banana republic; our request should not be taken for granted.” He said that the protest was suspended by the group to allow both the Irish and UK governments to consider the request of the group to reverse the $9.6bn judgment.
