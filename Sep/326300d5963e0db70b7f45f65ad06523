John Alechenu, Abuja Elder statesman, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, has said a resort to threats and blackmail by the South-East was a disservice to the region’s quest for power come 2023. Yakasai said on Sunday that while he was one among several Nigerians who were advocating the South-East to produce the next president, blackmailing the rest of the country would definitely work against such  an aspiration. The elder statesman said, “While I, all along, have been advocating a President for Nigeria from the zone, I would like to advise that issuing threats as was reflected in the views ascribed to my good friend, Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife, is, in my views, not the right approach to achieve that objective in a multi-dimensional country such as Nigeria. “Besides, the normal way of political advocacy is done through persuasion rather than threats and blackmail.” Copyright PUNCH.
