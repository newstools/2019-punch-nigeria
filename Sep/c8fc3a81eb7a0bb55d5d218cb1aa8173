Eleven Chinese relatives married and divorced each other 23 times within a month to obtain apartments given out by the state, Chinese media reported. The cunning family came up with the scheme after officials offered 40-square-metre apartments to residents living in an area where homes were demolished, as part of a development project in eastern Zhejiang province. The ploy started when a man named Pan re-married his ex-wife Shi, according to the state-run Global Times on Tuesday. They decided to tie the knot again on March 6 because Shi was registered as a resident of the local village, a paper needed to win a free apartment.
