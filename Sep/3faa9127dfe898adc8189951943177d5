Chelsea midfielder N’Golo Kante has sustained another hamstring injury, subsequently ruling him out of the Premier League fixture with Brighton & Hove Albion. On his first outing back from an ankle problem, Kante impressed against Liverpool last weekend, and the Frenchman was expected to feature against the Seagulls on Saturday afternoon. However, the World Cup winner was not present in the starting lineup for the game at Stamford Bridge, leading to questions about the Frenchman. According to the club’s official Twitter account, manager Frank Lampard has revealed that Kante suffered ‘a niggle’ in his hamstring during training on Friday. Kante also had to contend with issues in the same area during the closing weeks of last season, before eventually being able to play in the Europa League final. While no timeframe has been given for his recovery, Chelsea will hope to have one of their key men available for Wednesday’s Champions League meeting with Lille.
