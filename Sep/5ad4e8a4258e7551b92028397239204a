Ademola Babalola, Ibadan No fewer than seven people were on Wednesday injured as four fuel-laden trucks were gutted by fire in the loading section of the depot of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, Apata, Ibadan Oyo State. The fire incident completely damaged the loading point of the depot with pumps and the roof affected. No life was however lost to the incident. The immediate cause of the fire could not be ascertained, but a source attributed the incident to an electrical surge. A driver of one of the affected tankers, who did not want his name in print, however, said the fire was caused by one of the tanker drivers at the loading point. He said, “One of the tanker drivers was using the battery of another truck to start his truck. It was in the process the fire started.” The fire, which lasted for about two hours, was, however, quenched by a combined team of the Oyo State Fire Service and men of the NNPC. One of the persons injured, identified simply as Moji, sustained severe burns. The police spokesman, Gbenga Fadeyi, confirmed the incident, saying  policemen were deployed in the area  to prevent a breakdown of law and order. “Sequel to this, the Commissioner of Police, Shina Olukolu, and the DCP operations, Kehinde Longe, visited the scene for on-the-spot assessment,” he added.
