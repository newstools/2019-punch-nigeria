Adelani Adepegba The Commonwealth of Zion Assembly has said rape allegations against its founder Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo were fuelled by envy against his flourishing ministry. The church insisted that Fatoyinbo never raped Busola, wife of popular artiste, Timi Dakolo, who claimed the pastor raped her in 2002 when she was 17. The Executive Senior Assistant to the Senior Pastor of COZA, Ademola Adetuberu, in a statement in Abuja on Saturday said, “We see this ugly development fuelled by envy and sheer jealousy as an unnecessary distraction and a fight from the pit of hell against the ministry that God gave Rev Biodun Fatoyinbo, as well as declaration of war against the Church of Christ to which COZA is a flourishing branch under God’s grace.” The church said it decided to break its long silence over the allegations against its founder following “unprovoked satanic campaign of calumny orchestrated against the leadership and members of COZA by agents of darkness.” COZA said it did not support rape or sexual molestation in any form; it said it, in fact, stood with rape victims, as well as Fatoyinbo, who it said was a victim of organised blackmail.
