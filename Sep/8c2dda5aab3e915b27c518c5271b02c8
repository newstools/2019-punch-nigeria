Ted Odogwu, Kano Kano State Government has denied reports  it is planning to dethrone  the Emir of Kano,  Muhammad Sanusi II. A  Kano group, Renaissance Coalition, had alleged in a  statement by its spokesman, Ibrahim  Waiya,  that  the state government was planning  to transfer Sanusi  to Bichi Emirate. According to the statement, if the monarch resists the move, he will be sent packing. However, the group  cautioned Governor Abdullahi Ganduje against the move, saying it could  destabilise the peace and stability being enjoyed in the state. The group had  threatened  to compel the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency in Kano if the governor went ahead with the alleged plans to dethrone the former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria. But the   Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Abba Anwa, insisted Ganduje had no plans  to either transfer  or remove  the emir from the throne. Copyright PUNCH.
