Wife of the Vice President, Mrs Dolapo Osinbajo, has appealed to Nigerian youths to desist from copying the lifestyle of people on the Internet as it was a mere illusion. According to her, most internet users live on borrowed robes to impress their fans. She noted that many of them were living illusionary lifestyles that were not in conformity with reality. Osinbajo also called for prayers to uplift the well-being of the girl child. She made the call during the 49th session of the ‘Benue Women in Prayers’ organised by the wife of Benue State governor, Mrs Eunice Ortom, held at Chapel of Grace Government House in Makurdi. Osinbajo, who read Psalms 24:6-10 and Zachariah 2:5, explained that women had responsibility for looking after the life of their loved ones and praying against every challenge confronting their homes. He added that with fervent prayers, Benue would have no cause to cry again. In her welcome address Mrs Ortom said women in the state had set aside every quarter of the year to come together to give thanks to God and use the opportunity to empower the underprivileged across the state.
