Queen Elizabeth II’s granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged to marry property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Thursday. The couple “became engaged while away for the weekend in Italy earlier this month,” the palace said in a statement, adding that the wedding will take place in 2020. Beatrice is the daughter of Prince Andrew, who has recently been forced to defend himself over damaging accusations about his friendship with US financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
