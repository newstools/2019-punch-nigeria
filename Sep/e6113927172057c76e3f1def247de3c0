Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri The military has made good its threat to close down offices of any non-governmental organisations found to be involved with Boko Haram with the clampdown on offices of Mercy Corps in the North-East. The military during the closure of the office of Action Against Hunger (AAH) last week had warned other organisations that it would move against them  if found culpable. Sources in the humanitarian community in the North-East told our correspondent on Wednesday that the military moved against Mercy Corps when a driver conveying smoked fish with hidden N20m told the military that the good were from Mercy Corps. A source said, “The driver had thought that he would be allowed to go through the military checkpoint after dropping the name of Mercy Corps, but the soldierd conducted a search and the money was found hidden among the smoked fish he was transporting.” He said the military consequently shut Mercy Corps offices in Gwoza, Damboa, Maiduguri and Damaturu. Meanwhile the Action Against Hunger said it “strongly reject the accusation of aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation made against it by the military. It said in a statement on Wednesday, it added that it was, however, working with the Nigerian authorities to try and resolve the situation. Attempt to contact the military on the reason for closing the offices of Mercy Corps in Borno and Yobe states was unsuccessful as the spokesman of the Operation Lafiya Dole, Col. Ado Isa, did not pick his call or responded to test a message sent to his mobile phone.. Copyright PUNCH.
