Leke Bayewu Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila, says President Muhammadu Buhari will submit the 2020 budget proposal to the National Assembly by the end of this month.  Gbajabiamila, who spoke shortly after closed-door meeting with the President, said, “I cannot give you a definite answer but I know the budget is going to come as early as possible. It may be the end of this month or shortly thereafter, but I cannot give you and definite date. “But it’s going to be an early presentation so that we can pass the budget before the end of the year and return to the January to December cycle.” The speaker said he also discussed insecurity and the $9.6bn judgment against Nigeria in favour of  Process and Industrial Development with Buhari.
