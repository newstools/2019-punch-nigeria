Tobi Aworinde, Abuja A former member of the National Youth Service Corps, Success Ezeanya, has lamented the failure of the government to rescue his former colleague, Abraham Amuta, who was abducted in Borno State by gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram members, alongside a Winners Chapel pastor, identified simply as Oyeleke. The gunmen had kidnapped Amuta and three other members of the church, including Oyeleke, in April on their way to Chibok to distribute relief items to internally displaced persons and evangelise residents of the area. The Boko Haram members were said to have demanded a ransom of N200m for their release. Ezeanya, who completed his service earlier this year, told our correspondent in a text message that the abducted corps member was slowly fading from the memory of the people, who knew him in Borno State. The former NYSC member said though Amuta had a barbershop in the lodge, where his colleagues used to have their hair cut, most people had lost hope of his freedom over time and moved on with their lives. “People are gradually forgetting them. Amuta’s tools that he used as a barber are still parked up here and his batch has passed out,” Ezeanya stated. Copyright PUNCH.
