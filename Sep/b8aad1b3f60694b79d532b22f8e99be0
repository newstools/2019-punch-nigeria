Chima Azubuike, Gombe The Code of Conduct Bureau has said  Gombe State  Governor Inuwa Yahaya, his deputy, Dr Manassah Jatau, and all members of the House of Assembly have submitted their asset declaration forms. The Director of the CCB in the state, Amana Panyi,  said  this in an interview with our correspondent in Gombe on Friday. According to him, all political  appointees have  also  submitted their forms. He said, “One thing we have realised in the Gombe office of the Code of Conduct Bureau is the level of compliance. The second to the last paragraph of Gombe appointment letters usually stipulate that you declare your assets or else you are not interested in the appointment. “The bureau was not set up to punish public office holders, but to guide them in ensuring that government business doesn’t suffer. Aside from agriculture, public officer holders are not  allowed to go into  personal businesses.” Panyi said  the  constitution required  every government  employee  to declare their assets. He said,  “For a career civil servant, it is done every four years and for public office holders, it is before and after their tenure. It is after the submission that the job begins. Normally we do  verification.” Copyright PUNCH.
