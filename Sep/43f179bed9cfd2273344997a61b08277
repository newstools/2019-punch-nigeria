Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Security on Monday was tightened at the Jaji Military Cantonment as military investigators commenced interrogation of suspected killers of Commander Oluwayemisi Ogundana. Ogundana was the Commandant of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College’s Secondary School until she was murdered and her dismembered body dumped in a shallow well in Ungwan Loya village near the cantonment. Though both Kaduna State Police Command and AFCSC have remained silent, it was learnt that the suspects held in connection with the incident had been under intense interrogation. A source told our correspondents that  an officer of  the PTA  of the school  and his accomplice were being seriously  quizzed. The source said, “The authorities are quizzing the suspected killers of Ogundana, who is a staff member of the college and his accomplice.” .Copyright PUNCH.
