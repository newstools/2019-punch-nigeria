A woman was mauled to death by her dogs in Widnes, Cheshire, on Tuesday evening. The victim has been identified as mother-of-three Elayne Stanley. “Screams were heard from neighbours as the two dogs attacked Ms Stanley, 44, who was at home with her three daughters, including 12-year-old twins,” Yahoo News has reported. The dogs, described as American bulldog or Dogue de Bordeaux type breeds, attacked their owner in the house on Graham Road at around 5.15pm on Tuesday. Neighbours said they believe the victim’s 12-year-old twins were at home at the time and may have witnessed the attack. Ms Stanley’s elder daughter, who is in her 20s, also ran to help get the dogs off her mother and into a yard at the back of the house. Cheshire Police said formal identification of the victim has not yet taken place and they have not released a name. Locals described hearing screams and frantic attempts to get the dogs out of the house as they savaged their victim. Police later shot one of the dogs, a male named DJ; and a second dog, a bitch called Billy, was tranquillised and taken away, according to locals.
