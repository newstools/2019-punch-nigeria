More than 5,200 climate strikes will be held in 156 countries around the world from September 20 to 27, as part of the Global Climate Strike inspired by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist, Greta Thunberg. Thunberg called for immediate action on climate change on Twitter late on Thursday. The strike comes after children from the Fridays For Future movement walked out of schools in May to demand action against global warming, asking adults to join them the next time. Fridays For Future started in 2018 following the call by Thunberg, who protested against the lack of climate action in front of the Swedish parliament every day for three weeks during school hours. “Tomorrow we strike back! Global Climate Strike September 20 to September 27th: 5,225 events in 156 countries on all seven continents and counting!” she wrote on Twitter. The largest actions are expected to be held in the U.S. and Europe. Russian organisers said that 27 strikes would be held across the country, including in Kaliningrad, Sochi, Saint Petersburg, and Kirov. The strike comes ahead of UN Climate Action Summit 2019, which will start in New York on September 23. (Sputnik/NAN)
