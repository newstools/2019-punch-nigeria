Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Nigeria-South Africa Bi-National Commission has met in Pretoria, six years after it held a meeting on various bilateral matters. The meeting came at a time the relations between the countries was at a low ebb following the xenophobic attacks on foreign nationals in South Africa leading to the evacuation of over 500 Nigerians. Addressing the meeting in Pretoria on Thursday, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mustapha Sulaiman, said the BNC would be inaugurated at the summit level by President Muhammadu Buhari during his state visit scheduled for October 3, 2019. According to him, the main focus of the meeting is to finalise all relevant draft agreements and Memoranda of Understanding, especially the ones that bordered on defence and security, energy and socio-economic, trade and politics. These agreements, Suleiman said, would foster increased cooperation and collaboration that would mutually benefit the two countries and people. He stated, “I urge all members of the various working groups to work assiduously to ensure completion of all necessary draft Agreements/MoUs for final presentation at the meeting of ministers and signing on the sidelines of the state visit.” Copyright PUNCH.
