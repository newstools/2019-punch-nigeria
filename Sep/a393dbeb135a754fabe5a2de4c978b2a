Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo Taraba State Governor, Mr. Darius Ishaku, on Monday said Nigeria as a country is not yet mature after 59 years of Independence. Decrying the nation’s situation, the governor lamented, “We’ve failed to take Nigeria to enviable position.” He called for a drastic change in attitude and approach to governance. Ishaku spoke while answering questions from journalists in Jalingo shortly after he arrived the state from Abuja. Ishaku said, “Yes, we are 59 years old, but I don’t think we are 59 years mature — it is sweet and ugly. “It is sweet because we have independence, but ugly because we have not been able to utilise the 59 years to take the country to an enviable position. “It’s a shame that Nigeria as a giant of Africa is still lagging behind. “I was in Rwanda and I was amazed at their development in the healthcare sector alone. “Here we are being called the giant of Africa, but are just sitting giant. “A lot still needs to be done. We need to transform our thinking, work hard in education, health and power, among others. “If we can improve on power alone, the multiplier effects will be tremendous,” he said. Governor Ishaku, who won his election case at the tribunal in Abuja, said he will consolidate on his achievements in agriculture, education, and healthcare, among others, for the good of the people of Taraba State.
