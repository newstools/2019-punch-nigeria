’Femi Asu African business leaders are less optimistic about the strength of the global economy and their organisations’ ability to grow revenues in both the short and medium term than they were a year ago, a new report has said. A quarter of African Chief Executive Officers (25 per cent) believe that the global economy will decline over the next 12 months, according to the PwC’s Africa Business Agenda 2019 report launched at the biannual World Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town on Wednesday. The report found that the unease about global economic growth was also dampening CEOs’ confidence about their own companies’ outlook in the short term, with 27 per cent of CEOs stating they were “very confident” in their own companies’ prospects for revenue growth over the next 12 months. Only 39 per cent said they were “very confident” about their organisations’ growth prospects over the next three years. Commenting on the survey findings, the CEO for PwC Africa, Dion Shango, said, “As they look forward to the year ahead, African CEOs are less confident about the prospects for the global economy than they were a year ago. The same is true when they consider the prospects for their own organisation’s growth.” Copyright PUNCH.
