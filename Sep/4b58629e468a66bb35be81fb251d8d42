Current holder of Queen Moremi Ajasoro beauty pageant, 20-year-old Oreoluwa Toluhi, has frowned at primary and secondary schools organising beauty pageants, saying it will cause academic distraction for the children. Toluhi spoke exclusively with the News Agency of Nigeria on Saturday in Lagos. According to the student of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, the trend is gradually creeping into private primary and secondary schools. Toluhi, whose pet project is promoting female and children entrepreneurs, said that the trend should be stopped, as pageantry should be left for mature ladies 18 years and above. “Beauty contest should be practised only at the higher schools of learning and not at the primary and secondary school levels, which some private schools are gradually introducing. “I totally condemn it and declare that such practice should not be encouraged because these children will begin to nurse beauty and fashion in their minds, instead of focusing on their studies,” she said. The fashion enthusiast and model urged the education management boards to adopt proactive measures to checkmate such practices. “Participating in beauty contest at the early stage of their lives will not add any value to them,” Adedamola said. She said that students attention should be channeled toward academic competitions such as debates, quiz competitions , cultural promotions and talent hunts, “which will improve and boost children’s academic performance and pursuit in life.” NAN reports that Queen Toluhi succeeded Shola Shittu, who was crowned by the maiden Queen, Miss Blessing Animasaun. NAN also reports that Queen Moremi Ajasoro beauty pageant was instituted by the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, and the show is organised by the House of Oduduwa Foundation. (NAN)
