Patrick Odey, Uyo The United Evangelical Church (Qua Iboe) located on Ikot Ekpene Road, where Governor Udom Emmanuel worships in  Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, was on Sunday sealed by the police. But a source in the church said the action of the police might not be unconnected with the lingering crisis rocking the church, in which some persons, including the governor, had allegedly been accused of having personal interest in the matter. However, the governor, on Sunday, said he had no personal interest in the crisis, adding that he was rather committed to ensuring that peace returned to the church, which was originally founded as Qua Iboe Church. He said, “In a peace meeting I had with the leadership of the church on Thursday, September 26, the parties were very satisfied with the plans outlined.  Very soon, we hope to see the full restoration of peace and understanding between the two groups.” The state Commissioner of Police, Zaki Ahmed, said the police took the action because there was a clash among the worshippers last Sunday. He said, “We got information that a faction of the church was coming there to cause more trouble; so our officers were there.” Copyright PUNCH.
