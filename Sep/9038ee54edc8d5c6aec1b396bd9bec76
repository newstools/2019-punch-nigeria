Peter Okoye of the PSquare fame has denied promising to give disqualified Big Brother Naija housemate, Tacha, N60 million. He made the denial in the light of reactions that have trailed the disqualification of the housemate and social media users flocking to his social media pages to remind him of his promise. In a trending video, where Okoye denied making the promise, Mr P as he is now known said he never promised to give her the money, but rather, he would help her to make the money. He, however, said that if anyone has any evidence of the moment he made the promise, he would give the person, N10 million.
