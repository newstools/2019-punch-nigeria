A 34-year-old Japanese man, Yusuke Taniguchi has been arrested for allegedly stealing the credit card information of over 1,300 people and using it to make purchases online. According to police, Taniguchi worked the register part-time at a mall in Koto City and whenever a customer paid with their credit card, the suspect allegedly memorized their 16-digit-number, name, expiry date, and security code, all in the time it took to process their purchase, reports Japan Today. Following Taniguchi’s arrest, police found a notebook containing the hundreds of names and numbers and are currently linking them to past incidents to determine the scope of his alleged crimes.
