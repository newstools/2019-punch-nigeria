Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Reports indicated on Tuesday that youths of the four host communities of Osifo, Osekwenike Agbere and Agbuetor in the Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State had taken over a flow station belonging to the Nigerian Agip Oil Company in the area. It was learnt that the aggrieved youths, under the auspices of Samabiri Agip Host Communities Youth Federation, shut down the operation of the NOAC over alleged neglect and marginalisation of the host communities by the oil firm. Officials of the group including the secretary, Akpoeyiemi Omoro, were quoted to have vowed to sustain the occupation of the oil facility until their demands were met. Among their demands were community development, youth employment and award of contracts to the indigenes of the communities. “Despite our peaceful disposition for over 20 years in our communities, the company has failed to fulfil its promise,” one of the youth officials, Perfect Ikperi, said.
