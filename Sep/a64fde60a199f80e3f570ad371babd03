Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja A Coalition of Civil Society Groups, on Tuesday, continued its protest to the British High Commission and the Embassy of Ireland in Abuja over the award of a $9.6bn fine against Nigeria by a United Kingdom court following a botched oil deal with an Irish firm, Process & Industrial Developments Ltd. Addressing the protesters at their resumed occupation of the Embassies on Tuesday, the President of the group, Etuk Williams said the British and Irish governments have been given 21-day ultimatum to call P&ID to order. They carried various placards with inscription such “$9.6bn judgement is a fraud,” “No to illegal take over of our national assets,” “Nigeria rejects fraudulent judgment from British judge,” among others. He described the judgment as a travesty of justice and a disrespect to the Nigerian government. He said while the group respects the responsibility of the courts, it frowns at the steps taken by the company and the Tribunal in the UK towards the dispute involving Nigerian government and P&ID. He said, “We are giving the British and Irish governments 21-day ultimatum to act and call the UK court, P&ID and Irish government to order. “If after 21 days and nothing happens,  we will come back to occupy the Embassies. We will sleep here, cook here and eat here until the judgment is reversed.” [READ ALSO] Mambilla project: Nigeria risks another $2.3bn fine The group stated that it embarked on the protests to send a strong message to the international community that Nigeria is not a lawless country. He added, “Nigeria is not a banana republic, our request should not be taken for granted.” He said the protest was suspended by the group to allow both the Irish and UK governments consider the request of the group to reverse the $9.6bn judgment.
