Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The European Union said it would allocate an additional €300, 000 (N102m) in humanitarian aid to provide life-saving treatment for malnourished children in Sokoto and Zamfara states. The funds, it said, would allow UNICEF to provide malnourished children and their mothers with immediate nutrition treatment. As many as 280,000 children under five years of age in Sokoto and Zamfara were estimated to be suffering from severe acute malnutrition, which is a life-threatening condition. The EU explained in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday that mobile health teams would be sent out to strengthen the capacity of health facilities in delivering comprehensive basic health care services, including supportive medical supervision. EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides, stated, “The EU is stepping up its humanitarian assistance in Nigeria to help in addressing without delay the child under-nutrition emergency that the northwest region is facing. “Our funding will contribute to deliver the much-needed treatment for children and improve access to basic health care. Timely help from the international community is essential to save children’s lives.” With communities in the region already struggling with the seasonal depletion of food reserves in-between harvests, the union said the current lack of access to their fields means that they were likely to miss the next harvest, thereby putting further pressure on already strained food resources. Since 2014, the EU had allocated almost €245m to help the people in need in the country, including €28m in 2019. Copyright PUNCH.
