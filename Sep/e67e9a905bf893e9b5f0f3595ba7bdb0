BOLA BAMIGBOLA The National President of The Apostolic Church, Nigeria, Pastor Samson Igwe, has urged the Federal Government to ensure that Nigerians evacuated  from South Africa as a result of xenophobic attacks are  properly reintegrated. Igwe, who stated this on Saturday while speaking to journalists during a familiarization visit to Ilesa Zonal Headquarter which oversees  his church’s  branches in Osun, Kogi, Ondo and Ekiti states stressed that failure to properly reintegrate the returnees would pose a huge  threat to Nigeria’s security. Condemning the xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other foreigners in South Africa, the cleric said some branches of the church in South Africa  were recording significant progress before the attacks. He said, “They are people who were forced to leave due to the attacks on  lives and property.  All they have laboured for have been destroyed and many of them came with nothing. “If they are not well catered for, they will add to our problems. The government should empower those who want to set up businesses among them and also ensure that those who need employment get jobs. “Most of them travelled to South Africa because Nigeria  failed them. Now that they are back, they must not be made to regret their coming  back so that they will not go  into crime. They have tasted good life and what good governance is, until recently so there is a limit to what they can endure.” Copyright PUNCH.
