Patrick Odey, Uyo Qua Iboe Church located along No.112 Ikot Ekpene Road, where Governor Udom Emmanuel worships in Uyo, the state capital was on Sunday morning sealed off by the Police. An aide to Emmanuel, who confirmed the incident but pleaded anonymity said, “Yes, I saw something like that this morning when I was passing by Ikot-Ekpene road. “I saw the Police gather and about three vans; and worshipers in large numbers.” It was gathered that the Police arrived the church premises as early
as 6am and barricaded the entrance, preventing early morning
worshipers from going in to worship. Attempts by our Correspondent to establish reason behind the issue was unsuccessful as at Press time, as the Police Public Relations Officer’s line was switched off, while the Commissioner of Police, Zaki Ahmed, did not pick his calls. But a source in the church said the action of the Police might not be
unconnected with the lingering crisis rocking the church, in which
some persons have been accused of having personal interest. Speaking on Sunday, Governor Emmanuel declared that he had no personal interest in the crisis, adding that he was rather committed to ensuring that peace returns to the United Evangelical Church which was originally founded as Qua Iboe Church. He said, “It is very wrong for certain elements to make unfounded
allegations concerning my role in the local assembly on Ikot Ekpene
road. “At a peace meeting I had with the leadership of the church on
Thursday, September 26, I outlined the processes and plans for
peace to return to the the local and the national leadership of
the church. “The parties were very satisfied with the plans outlined and went back very happy. “Very soon, we hope to see the full restoration of peace and understanding between the two groups.”
