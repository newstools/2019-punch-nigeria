*Says funding, a setback for road projects John Ameh, Abuja Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, admitted on Wednesday that poor funding was reason major road projects delayed since 2015. He said some communities made ridiculous compensation demands for roads traversing their localities, further causing problems for the projects. For instance, he said compensation payment on the 2nd Niger Bridge had already climbed to over N10bn. Fashola spoke with State House Correspondents after the weekly Federal Executive Council meeting in Abuja. He noted that not all the N300bn budgeted for roads was released. Meanwhile, he disclosed the FEC approved N8.2bn for road projects on Wednesday.
