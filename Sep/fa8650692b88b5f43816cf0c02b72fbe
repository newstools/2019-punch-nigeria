He said not only malnourished children would be covered under the latest intervention, but their mothers and infrastructure would be put in place to put an end to malnutrition in the region. He, however, lamented that the earlier intervention was faced with some challenges including insecurity which made project areas inaccessible. He also noted that the medical team were not able to access some areas in Borno State during the rainy season due to flooding and because some parts of the state have a scattered population, thus making it difficult to bring them together to medical facilities.
