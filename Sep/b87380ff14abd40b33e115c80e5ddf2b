Seven children were among 16 people killed Tuesday in twin airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition fighting rebels in southern Yemen, an official and a doctor said. “Sixteen people, including women and children, were killed and nine others injured” in a coalition air raid targeting a residence in Daleh province, the local official told AFP on condition of anonymity. A doctor at Al Thawra hospital in Ibb province where the bodies were taken said seven children and four women were among the dead. The Iran-backed Huthi rebels condemned the coalition for its “continued aggression” against the Yemeni people, according to their Al-Masirah television.

Tens of thousands of people, most of them civilians, have been killed since Saudi Arabia and its allies intervened in March 2015 in support of the beleaguered government. The fighting has also displaced millions and left 24.1 million — more than two-thirds of the population — in need of aid. The United Nations has described Yemen as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. (AFP)
