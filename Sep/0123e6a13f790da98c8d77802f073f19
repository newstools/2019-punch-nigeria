They took us up and after they took us up, I arranged for food that she would eat and myself. They prepared food and we ate. After that, we slept till when the day broke, around let’s say 4:00 a.m or 5:30 a.m. I brought out a knife. She didn’t know that the knife was there. I brought out the knife and threatened her that she should not shout. I told her that if she shouted, I would use the knife. With that fear, she didn’t shout. “By then, the volume of the television was loud. She kept quiet. After that, I used the wrapper, (the pillowcase) to tie her hands from the back and then tied her legs,” said West. West was apprehended by officials of the Federal Anti-Robbery Squad while he was on his way to Akwa Ibom State from his hideout in Rivers State. West was arrested with a military camouflage bag and brought to the State Police Command around 5:00 p.m. He was said to have confessed to killing 12 women; five in different hotels room in the Rivers, seven in Lagos and one other state not mentioned.
