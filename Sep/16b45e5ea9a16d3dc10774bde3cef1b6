Peter Dada, Akure The authorities of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Ondo State, have cautioned members of the public to be mindful of the activities of some unscrupulous persons defrauding unsuspecting candidates seeking admission into the institution. It was gathered that no fewer than 50 admission seekers had been duped by the fraudsters who sought admission into the institution. The Head of the Media and Protocol Department of the university, Mr Adegbenro Adebanjo, who confirmed the development, said the institution was alerted to the criminal activities of the fraudsters by some prospective admission seekers. According to him, the institution is highly embarrassed by the criminal activities of the fraudsters using the social media and the Internet to defraud admission seekers. He said the institution had been receiving reports in the last few days about some admission seekers falling prey to the activities of the fraudsters, claiming to be officials of the university. He said, “These impostors, through text messages and posting on the social media, claim to have the ability and connections to manipulate results of post-UTME screening for any candidate interested in gaining admission into FUTA. “Also, these fraudsters ask candidates through various social media platforms and other channels to call some phone numbers and pay huge amount of money into private accounts to facilitate admission.” Copyright PUNCH.
