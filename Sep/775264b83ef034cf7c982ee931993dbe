Ademola Babalola, Ibadan The Otun Olubadan of Ibadanland, High Chief Lekan Balogun, on Wednesday disclosed that the removal of their crowns was not part of the ongoing reconciliation with the Olubadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji. Speaking with The PUNCH, Balogun, who was elevated to crown-wearing Oba alongside 20 others at a ceremony on August 27, 2017 by former Governor Abiola Ajimobi, maintained that only the court could stop them from wearing the crowns. A media house (not The PUNCH) had reported on Tuesday that the high chiefs had given up their crowns in “deference to the supremacy of Olubadan.” Balogun, who said he held Olubadan in high esteem and revered him as a father, explained, “We didn’t give ourselves crowns. “We were made kings by the law and no other law has asked us to stop wearing crowns.” He continued, “Where did they (media) get the idea that we had dropped our crowns from? “Media people are just creating unnecessary crisis in the Olubadan-in-council. “We and the Olubadan did not discuss the issue of our crowns at all. “We even have no right to abandon it (crowns),” Balogun added in a brief phone chat with our Correspondent. Responding, the Olubadan cautioned against inflammatory remarks in the media. The Media Officer to Olubadan, Adeola Oloko, who did not make further comments, simply added, “Let’s allow sleeping dogs to lie.”
