’Femi Asu The total revenue collected by power distribution companies in the country rose to N233.5bn in the first half of this year from N218.4bn in the same period last year. The Discos’ revenue collection stood at N118.9bn in the second quarter, up from N114.6bn in Q1, the latest data obtained from the Association of National Electricity Distributors on Wednesday showed. ANED, the umbrella body for the Discos, said energy received in Q2 dropped to 6,912.8 gigawatt-hours from 6,950.8GWh in Q1, with energy billed being 5,587.5GWh (an equivalent of N180.8bn) and 5,576.8GWh (N176.5bn), respectively. The Discos’ collection efficiency improved to 66 per cent in Q2 from 65 per cent in Q1. “The energy received by Discos in Q2 was less than the amount received in Q1 for most of the Discos. Only Abuja Electricity Distribution Company, Ikeja Electric and Kano Electricity Distribution Company received more energy,” the association said in a document. ANED said, “In a yearly comparison, the revenue collection of all Discos has increased in N47bn (12 per cent), mostly due to the reduction of the aggregate technical, commercial and collection losses from 50.8 per cent to 46.7 per cent.” It said the aggregate technical and commercial losses went down from 23 per cent to 20 per cent and collection efficiency increased from 63 per cent to 66 per cent. The Discos collected N453bn as revenue from July 2018 to June 2019, compared to N406bn paid by consumers from July 2017 to June 2018, according to the data. “Nevertheless, some Discos show signs of fatigue in their ATC&C performance improvement in the last months. “Ikeja Electric has broken a new record in the ATC&C losses with 26.1 per cent in June, reducing 5.5 points in one year,” ANED said. It said two other Discos, Kano Electricity Distribution Company Plc and Jos Electricity Distribution Plc, reduced the ATC&C losses in the last 12 months by 8.6 points and 11.6 points, respectively. “For this year, most of the Discos have not been able to beat their last year’s records on collection efficiency,” the association added. The Discos said the energy sent out by the power generation companies was very inconsistent during Q2, adding,  “It dropped from a historical new record on April 3, 2019 of 109,370MWh down to a daily average lower that 90,000MWh.” In June, the number of registered customers reached 8,699,271, according to the Discos. ANED said, “During the last two years, the number of customers has grown by almost 1.5 million with an average of almost 60,000 new customers per month. “However, due to some delays in the MAP implementation on one side, the small capital expenditure allowance and the lack of access to finance, the number of metered customers remains the same, which is the reason why the metering penetration has decreased in almost four points down to 41.5 per cent.” Copyright PUNCH.
