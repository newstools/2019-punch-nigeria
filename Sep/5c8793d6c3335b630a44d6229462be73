ADENIYI OLUGBEMI The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Sokoto Zonal Office, on Friday, arrested the Director General of Sokoto Marshal Agency, Abdullahi Sa’idu, and an accountant with the agency, Bashar Dodo-Iya, who are all members of payment committee of the state’s marshal corps. They were arrested for alleged offences of conspiracy, money laundering and diversion of workers’ salaries to the tune of N10m. It resulted from a petition jointly signed and presented to the commission by 39 members of the agency, alleging that their three months salaries were being withheld without any reason. The petitioners also alleged that the suspects refused to pay their salaries and diverted the money for their personal use, saying that effort made to get their salaries paid, proved abortive. Preliminary investigation, according to an EFCC source, revealed that the two persons conspired and diverted about N10m meant for the marshals’ salaries. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed the arrest in a statement on Saturday. Copyright PUNCH.
