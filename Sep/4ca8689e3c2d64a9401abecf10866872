Meanwhile, Muhammad-Bima disclosed that his office had also issued 15 licences for the operation of filling stations, while approvals were given for the construction of 20 stations across the state. He also admonished motorists to steer clear of illegal filling stations, urging them to always patronise those selling unadulterated petroleum products. He explained that there was always fuel at filling stations, therefore, there was no need to patronise black markets. “If you buy fuel from filling stations and your car developed any problem or fault from it you can go to that filling station and report, unlike if you buy from roadside unregistered market,” he said.
