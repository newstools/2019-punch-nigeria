Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The Air Peace boss, Mr Allen Onyema, has told the House of Representatives that the evacuation of Nigerians from South Africa has brought respect to Nigeria across the world. Onyema also stated that South Africa is also suffering dearly for the attacks by its citizens on non-citizens. He said flights were now going to South Africa empty and while stocks in the country were falling. “That singular act has brought so much respect for Nigeria worldwide,” he said. The Air Peace boss said the pressure on South Africa forced the country to apologise to Nigeria and other African countries. “It wouldn’t have happened if the evacuation hadn’t taken place,” he said. According to him, xenophobia will die a natural death soon in South Africa. Onyema got another standing ovation and a long round of applause after his speech.
