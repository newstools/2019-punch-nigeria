Ted Odogwu, Kano The Kano State Graveyard Standing Committee says floods at the weekend destroyed thousands of graves in some urban and rural cemeteries within the state. The Assistant Secretary of the committee, Alhaji Yusuf Tarouni, said the downpour ravaged some of the visited cemeteries at Dan Hassan Settlement in the Kura Local Government Area; Rimin Kebbe, Fako in the NGA; and others in the Gwale LGA. Tarouni said the floods exhumed some dead bodies, which, he said, were seen littering the graveyard. He said the situation was worsened by the fact that some residents were engaged in open defecation at some of the cemeteries. ‘’At Dan Hassan, in the Kura Local Government Area, the graveyard is in a deplorable condition; it has been over flooded with water and the graves are collapsing on a daily basis. “Already, thousands of graves, where we visited and assessed, have collapsed. At the same time, we visited another graveyard in Gwale, where the people turned the graveyard into a dump for refuse, as well as grazing field for cows.’’ He called on the appropriate authorities to take necessary action. ‘’Insecurity in our graveyards is very disturbing, as people have converted graveyards to hiding places, since they are aware that nobody will dare chase them to the graveyards.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
