Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State has relieved the Special Adviser on Talent Development and Gender Education, Mrs. Helen Bob, of her appointment. Her dismissal was announced in a statement on Wednesday by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Fidelis Soriwei. Soriwei said the governor sacked Mrs. Bob for “repeated acts of gross misconduct, indiscipline, irresponsibility and acts unbecoming of a person occupying the high position of Special Adviser in any government whatsoever.” He said that she had been a Special Adviser for almost eight years. Soriwei said Mrs. Bob was among 130 Special Advisers, out of over 2,000 appointees, engaged by Dickson to render necessary services to the state and to give a sense of belonging and legitimate support to party members. The statement added that the governor wished Mrs. Bob well in her future endeavours.
