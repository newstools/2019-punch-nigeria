Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A 32-year-old driver, Harrison Chatchi, on Thursday, appeared before an Osun State Magistratesâ€™ Court sitting in Ile-Ife for causing the death of two students seeking admission into the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. Chatchi, who appeared before Magistrate Olukunle Owolawi, was arraigned on six counts bordering on reckless driving and manslaughter. The police prosecutor, Sunday Osanyintuyi, said the accused committed the offences on September 2, 2019, around 12.30pm at the RCC junction, Osu Expressway, Ile-Ife. He explained that Chatchi drove a bus with number plate AAA 454 XW against the traffic and in the process, crushed to death a 35-year-old motorcyclist, Sunday Oyemakinwa. Osanyintuyi said the driver also drove dangerously on a public highway and caused the death of 18-year-old Johnson Michael and 17-year-old Chinechorem Omoka. According to him, the offences contravene sections 4, 6 (10), 18 and 78 (1) of the Osun State Road Traffic Law, 2002. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges. His counsel, Mr Richardson Onyebueke, applied for bail on his behalf with a pledge that he would provide responsible sureties. Owolawi, however, declined the application and directed Onyebueke to file a written application for bail. He remanded Chatchi in the Ile-Ife Prison and adjourned the case till Thursday, October 31, for mention. Copyright PUNCH.
