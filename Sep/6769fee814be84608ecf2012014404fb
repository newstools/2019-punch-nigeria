The Kano State Hisbah Board on Thursday said it arrested 27 beggars in the Kano metropolis for allegedly violating the law banning street begging in the state. The Public Relations Officer of the board, Mallam Lawan Ibrahim, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Kano. Ibrahim said the arrests were carried out between 12am and 2am on Thursday at the Kano Guest Inn, Sabon Gari, Triumph and Railway areas. He said those who arrested include 18 males and nine female children, between the age of 13 and 19. Ibrahim said the board would continue to arrest beggars who refuse to abide by the law which banned street begging. He said, “They were screened and we found out that they were all first-time offenders, we invited their parents and relatives to hand them over and warned them to desist from such act.” Copyright PUNCH.
