Ademola Babalola, Ibadan The League of Imams and Alfas, South West Zone on Thursday in Ibadan defied earlier position of Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi and installed a renown Islamic scholar, Ustaz Abdul- Lateef Adekilekun as the Wazirul (Muminina) of Yorubaland. Oba Akanbi had in March, 2018 vowed to install Yaquob Abdul-Baki Mohammed as the Waziri of the entire Yorubaland. But the President, League of lmams and Alfas, South-West, Edo and Delta states, Sheikh Jamiu Bello, in a letter to Oba Akanbi, urged him to restrict the title to his domain, Iwo. The matter was laid to rest on Thursday as scores of Imams and Alfas across seven states converged on Ibadan and turbaned Adekilekun as the new Wazirul  Muminina amidst colourful celebration with the imprint of the National Board for Arabic and Islamic Studies in Nigeria. The NBAIS administrative officer, Tajudeen Olaoti described Adekilekun as “an accomplished educationist, author, historian, Islamic scholar and a philanthropist per excellence.” Waziri, who was recommended by the Osun State League of Imams and Alfas, is the Prime Minister of the Muslims saddled with the responsibility of coordinating their activities intellectually and administratively to ensuring religious harmony with people of other faiths.
