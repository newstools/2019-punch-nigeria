Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The Chief of Staff to the Kogi State Governor, Chief Edward Onoja, has called on the people of Igala Kingdom to maintain peace before, during and after the November 16 governorship election in the state. Onoja, who spoke during the conferment of the ‘Grand Commander of Igala Kingdom’ on him during the Igala Merit Award 2019 held at Igala Unity House Anyigba, maintained that no meaningful development could be attained in an atmosphere of violence and crisis. The governor’s aide, who is also the deputy governorship candidate to Governor Yahaya Bello, charged the people to be united, adding that the “little progress” made was a product of unity. He assured the Igala that more developments would come to them in the years to come. Earlier, the President of Igala Cultural and Development Association, Abubakar Amodu, noted that the reawakening of the Igala Kingdom came as a result of the collective efforts of Igala sons and daughters towards turning a new leaf. The ICDA President lauded the roles of the Igala indigenes on issues of development, saying more still needed to be done. He explained that the conferment on Onaja was for his “unquantifiable support” to the development of the ethnic nationality. Onoja, in his remarks, dedicated the award to the people, saying he was moved by the plight of his people and had a commitment to improve on their socio-economic well-being. The immediate-past Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Professor Stephen Ocheni, commended ICDA for “moving in the right direction.” Copyright PUNCH.
