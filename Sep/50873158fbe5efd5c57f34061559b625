A lawyer-blogger,Kaine Agary, on Monday revealed the one thing that unmarried lovers thinking of moving in together should do before getting started. Agary strongly recommended that couples intending to cohabit should consider drawing up a ‘Cohabiting Agreement’, where the partners would “define the terms of their relationship while it lasts and plans for its termination (whether it transitions to something more permanent or not).” She said, “I know that a cohabitation agreement is probably the farthest thing from the mind when the parties are falling head over heels in love. But it is a wise thing to do, to put all the cards on the table up front. The heart does what it does, you can’t really control that, but you can mitigate the loss from a broken heart by protecting your finances and property.

It can protect one party from credit agreements entered into by the other party. The agreement should also provide for debts incurred in the sole name of either of the parties. “Living expenses must also be provided for. Will they be shared equally or in proportion to their respective incomes or in some other proportion as agreed? What about life insurance? Will both parties effect a policy to provide for the benefit of the other on their death? Under the cover of marriage, there are certain presumptions…there are no guarantees when you are ‘shacking up’.”
