Sola Shittu, Benin The police in Edo State have arrested a 44-year old man, Edoghogho Omorogbe, for killing his mother-in-law, sister-in-law and a six-month-old baby. Edoghogho reportedly killed the victims on September 17, 2019 in their residence at Iguadolor Community in the Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. But a two-year-old girl inside the room at the time of attack was spared. The deceased were identified as Mrs Alice Omorogbe aged 52; Mrs Blessing Efe, 25, and baby Osarumwense. Their mutilated bodies were discovered the following morning in the room. Edoghogho said he killed his in-laws because they usually hired thugs to beat him anytime he quarreled with his wife. “I am a tipper driver but since the rains started, I was doing menial jobs. I killed them out of annoyance because my mother-in-law engaged thugs to beat me up whenever I quarrel with my wife.
