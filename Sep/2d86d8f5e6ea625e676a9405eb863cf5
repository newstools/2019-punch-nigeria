Professor John Idoko, the President of Nigeria’s bidding committee for 2021 edition of International Conference on AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Africa on Monday said the country lost the bidding right due to international politics. He told News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja that the conference would now take place in Rwanda in December, with 10000 delegates expected to attend. Idoko, who stressed the need for Nigerian leaders to improve on the international image of the country, explained that the perception of some countries must be changed for mutual international relations to take place.

He noted that even though the country lost the right to host ICASA, it would not deter government from working toward attaining the desired goal of stemming HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile, the Rwanda ICASA will be the 20th edition and has “AIDS FREE AFRICA – Innovation, Community and Political Leadership” as its theme. (NAN)
