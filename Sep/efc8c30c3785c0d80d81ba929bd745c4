John Ameh, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari said on Tuesday that his administration was committed to reducing extreme poverty and hunger in the country. He spoke in New York at the Nigeria ‘high-level side-event’ on “SDG Integration – Bridging the Policy Planning – Budgeting Gap for the Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,” on the sidelines of the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Buhari told the session that one example was the plan to take 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years. “It is for this reason that in May this year, we committed ourselves to lifting approximately 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within a 10-year period. “This is a national development priority and in line with the aspirations of the SDGs. We have since established an ambitious National Social Investment Programme targeting the poor and vulnerable members of the Nigerian population”, a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, quoted Buhari as saying.
