A female employee of the Zambia National Commercial Bank was suspended for allegedly sleeping with over 200 different men, including job seekers. The woman who has been identified as Mutale Winfridah is a branch senior bank executive, according to ZambianObserver . She was said to have used her influence, promising job seekers employment at the bank and approving bank loan applications only if they were able to sleep with her. The decision to suspend the 39-year-old Mutale, who is still unmarried was taken after more than 10 men formally lodged complaints against her the report has said. It added that she had remained unmarried because of her quest to attain different academic qualifications before finding a partner. The bank is yet to make public if there would be any further sanctions the Obsrver said.
