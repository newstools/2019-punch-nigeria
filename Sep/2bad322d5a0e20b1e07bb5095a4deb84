Abiodun Nejo Fresh students of the Federal University, Oye Ekiti, are to pay N50,000 as acceptance fee, an increase of N15,000 above the N35,000 payable last session. The Public Relations Officer of the university, Mr Geoffrey Bakji, said the increase was necessitated by the need to provide infrastructure due to the growing population of the school. “The population of the students is over-stretching the infrastructure, so we want to use the acceptance fees to erect structures that will accommodate the students being admitted,” Bakji told our correspondent on the telephone. The spokesperson said in 2018, the school admitted 6,500 fresh students, saying the figure might increase this year. Copyright PUNCH.
