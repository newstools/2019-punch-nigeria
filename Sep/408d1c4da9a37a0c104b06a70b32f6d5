John Ameh, Abuja The Presidency said on Sunday that President Muhammadu Buhari had not abandoned his kinsmen hit by flooding in Daura, Katsina State. It said, rather, the National Emergency Management Agency sent relief materials to the victims within 48 hours. “Contrary to the allegations that President Muhammadu Buhari has turned his back on the people of Daura, we can confirm that pre-assessment relief materials were dispatched to the victims within 48 hours of the flood,” the Presidency said in a statement by Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr Garba Shehu. It noted that so far, the victims of the flooding, which occurred last week, had received supplies, including food items and would get more in due course. “Ten trailer loads of building materials including zinc, planks and cement, as well as tons of grains, cereals and other edibles have so far been delivered. “NEMA has equally promised that as soon as the assessment of the damage to the flood-ravaged communities is done, more materials would be dispatched,” the statement said.
