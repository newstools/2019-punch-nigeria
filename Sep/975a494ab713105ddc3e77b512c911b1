Okechukwu Nnodim The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has blamed the Federal Road Safety Corps and the Directorate of Motor Vehicle Administration for the untimely death of an employee of the oil firm. It called on the corps and other relevant agencies to rise up to their mandate of making the nation’s roads safe by keeping smoky vehicles that exceed the approved emissions limit off the road. NNPC’s Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Ndu Ughamadu, made the call on Tuesday when the colleagues of an NNPC staff who died in a road crash visited him to register their pain. Stating the reason for the call, the NNPC spokesperson said the loss of Mr Dewari Aye, a staff of the Career Development and Appraisal Unit of the Group Human Resources Division, in a road crash along the Kubwa-Abuja Expressway on Monday evening was caused by a truck that was emitting thick smoke that impeded the vision of road users. Ughamadu said, “Apart from the environmental hazard caused by these trucks that belch thick smoke from their exhaust, the smoke impedes the vision of other road users, as was the case with our colleague who was reported to have run into the truck and died.” He said the untimely death of Aye and others who had died in similar circumstances would have been averted if the FRSC and the Directorate of Motor Vehicle Administration were alive to their duties by impounding smoky vehicles that constitute safety hazards on the roads.
