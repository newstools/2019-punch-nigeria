MUDIAGA AFFE Owner of De Young Shall Grow Motors Limited, Chief Vincent Obianodo, has dragged Amuwo-Odofin Local Government Area to court over the seizure of a parcel of land belonging to his company, Vinee Oil Nigeria Limited, located in FESTAC, Lagos State. In suit No LD/8237LMH/19, Obianodo is seeking an interlocutory injunction from the Lagos State High Court, Lagos Division, to restrain further action on the land by the council, pending the determination of the case. He said the Amuwo-Odofin LGA illegally trespassed on the land at Second Avenue in Festac and was also seeking N100m damages for the alleged trespass. Counsel for Obianodo, Mr Kennedy Okwara, said crisis broke out between the prominent businessman and the council after the illegal seizure of the land near Agboju market and its conversion into the proposed ‘Ope-Oluwa Market’ by the council. Okwara said the council trespassed on the land in violation of the Lagos State Properties Protection Law (2016), which forbids forceful takeover of another person’s property. He recalled that following the acquisition of the expansive FESTAC/Amuwo Odofin land from Oluwa, Alado, Alamuwo and Onitire families in 1976, the land was vested in the Federal Housing Authority, which allocated it to Obianodo in 1992.
