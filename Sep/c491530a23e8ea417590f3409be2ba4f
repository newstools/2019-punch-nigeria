Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, on Tuesday said the World Bank would soon embark on some legacy projects worth about $500m across the state. Fayemi said no fewer than five legacy projects that would cost $500m “would be starting in the state across many of the local governments within the next few months”. The governor spoke in Ado Ekiti, the state capital, while presenting cheques worth N180m to 19 benefiting communities under the state’s self-help community development programme. The governor said he was determined to improve technical education by ensuring that all the technical colleges in the state were upgraded to improve skills development and education of the citizens. He promised continued collaboration with development partners to ensure that people at the grass roots were not left out in the scheme of things. Fayemi said, “We are poised to make similar meaningful impact in every stratum of our society. As a government that wants both urban and rural developments, we paid our own counterpart fund to activate this World Bank project geared towards improving the living condition of people at the grassroots. “When you entrusted the management of Ekiti State’s commonwealth in our care, we promised and assured you all that your welfare and well-being will be of paramount interest to us. We are here today to strengthen the bond and deliver one of our promises.” Copyright PUNCH.
