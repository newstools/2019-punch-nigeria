Alexander Okere The Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria is seeking an arrangement with the Federal Inland Revenue Service to join hands with it to bolster government’s revenue generation from non-oil sector of the economy. The CITN said the collaboration was part of its quest to make taxation the foremost driver of the Nigeria’s revenue generation. The Institute observed that the Federal Government agency had done credibly well in its revenue drive and deployment of innovative technologies to boost government revenue from non-oil sector of the economy. The Registrar/Chief Executive, CITN, Adefisayo Awogbade, said this in a statement on Friday. He noted that between 2012 and 2014, oil revenue accounted for 57.28 per cent while non-oil revenue accounted for 42.72 per cent. He was of the opinion that Nigeria’s revenue base should be shifted from oil and gas to non-oil sector if maximally utilized. He added that Nigeria’s economy had for many years been dependent upon revenues derived from oil and gas, which led to the infamous economic meltdown leading to decline in revenue generated from petroleum resource from early 2000 till date.
