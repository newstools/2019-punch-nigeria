A man suspected of selling beef has been beaten to death by a mob in India’s eastern state of Jharkhand, police and news reports said Monday. Two other men were critically injured and admitted to hospital after the incident, which took place in the district of Khunti on Sunday. India’s Hindu majority regards cows as holy and their slaughter is banned in most states, including Jharkhand. There has been a string of attacks by right-wing Hindus over cattle slaughter and beef consumption in the country in recent years. According to police, a group of 15 villagers caught hold of the three men and started beating them for allegedly selling beef at a riverside market, broadcaster Times Now reported.
