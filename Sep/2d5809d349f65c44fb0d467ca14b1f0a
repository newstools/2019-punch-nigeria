The Jandor Foundation has empowered some micro enterprises in Badagry with essential tools. The foundation said in a statement that it held an empowerment programme recently where artisan groups and associations were empowered with work tools such as hair clippers, sewing and grinding machines as well as cash gifts. “Various market women also received support from the foundation to boost their various trade businesses,” the foundation’s Lead Visioner and Chairman, Core Media Group, Mr Abdul-Azeez Adediran, said. Adediran commended the lawmaker representing Badagry Federal Constituency at the Federal House of Representatives, Mr Babatunde Hunpe, for “his unwavering efforts to get the government’s attention to fixing the dilapidated Badagry-Lagos road.” He urged Badagry traditional rulers to advocate the reconstruction of the road, saying, “The state of the Badagry road is inimical to the progress of the great people of Badagry.“ He commended Hunpe for engaging officials of the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency in Abuja to make an enquiry about plans to fix the road, saying, “Upon my visit to FERMA, I discovered that he had also visited for the same purpose.”
