A 74-year-old Indian man, Shyam Lal Yadav, has grown a four-inch horn after he suffered a head injury in 2014. Doctors at Bhagyoday Tirth Hospital in Sagar city, India removed the horn from Yadav’s head recently. Yadav, who is a farmer from Rahli village in Madhya Pradesh, had suffered a head injury in 2014 which led to the formation of a rare cutaneous horn, reports Daily Mail. The benign growth is also known as the devil’s horn. It was reported that the rare growths are made out of keratin, found in toenails and human hair, and most common in older adults.

A surgeon, Dr Vishal Gajbhiye, who participated in the surgery said, “Around five years ago the patient had hurt his head after which a lump started growing. Initially, he ignored it as it did not cause any discomfort. Also, he got the growth cut by the local barber. “But when the lump hardened and started growing further, he approached the hospital at Sagar.” Gajbhiye stated that while the growth can be cut off, there was a need to treat the underlying condition. While the growth has been cut, the doctors are yet to determine the underlying cause.
