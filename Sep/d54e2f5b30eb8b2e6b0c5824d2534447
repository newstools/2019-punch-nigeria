Essien Ayi, concerning Bakassi/Calabar South/Akpabuyo Federal Constituency. In all the judgments, the judges said the crux of the petitions was the petitioners’ complaint that they were unlawfully excluded from participating in the elections held on February 23, 2019 by the Independent National Electoral Commission. The first, second and fifth judgments; EPT/CAL/S/09/2019, EPT/CAL/HR/06/2019, and EPT/CAL/HR/10/2019 were read by the chairman of the tribunal Justice Babawale, while Justice S.B. Shuaibu read the judgment in suit number EPT/CAL/HR/07/2019, and Justice M. C. Okoh read the judgment in suit number EPT/CAL/HR/08/2019. While upholding the victories of the PDP candidates at the polls, the tribunal said “APC should blame itself for what has befallen them because it was the unresolved internal dispute within the ranks of the party that gave rise to a court judgment which INEC obeyed. “The delisting of APC candidates by INEC on the eve of the polls was not unlawful as contended by the petitioners because the judgment of the Federal High Court in suit number FHC/C/73/2018 remained valid and was bound to be obeyed as constitutionally provided.” The judges said the election tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain the five petitions as they qualified as post-election matters. Justice Babawale also advised APC to instil discipline in its ranks and blame itself, not INEC, for the loss in Cross River State.
