Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Katsina and Imo State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunals on Saturday affirmed the elections of  Governors Aminu Masari of Katsina State and Emeka Ihedioha of Imo State. While Masari is of the All Progressives Congress, Ihedioha is of the Peoples Democratic Party. The two separate tribunals‎ sat and delivered their judgments in Abuja. In ‎their majority judgment, Justice Dele Omotosho and Justice A.I Ityonuyiman, held that the petitioners failed to prove the allegations of non-compliance with the Electoral Act which they alleged marred the conduct of the poll. They held that the petitioners provided no cogent evidence to back their petition. ‎They also contended that contrary to the petitioners’ claim, Governor Masari was qualified to contest the Katsina governorship election. They added the name Aminu Bello Masari was the same as Aminu Masari, and that the governor was not bound to disclose certain number of names in his form submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission. The Imo State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal also on Saturday dismissed three petitions challenging Governor Ihedioha’s victory at the March 9, 2019 poll. The three petitions were filed by the All Progressives Grand Alliance and its candidate, Ifeanyi Ararume,  Action Alliance Party, and its candidate Mr Uche Nwosu, as well as the All Progressives Congress, and its candidate, Hope Uzodinma. The three-man tribunal led by Justice Malami Dogondaji, unanimously held that the petitions lacked merit. The tribunal also held that the petitioners failed to prove that Ihedioha was unlawfully declared as the governor of the state by INEC. Justices Aminu Saad and Idaat Moji-Sule were members of the panel.
