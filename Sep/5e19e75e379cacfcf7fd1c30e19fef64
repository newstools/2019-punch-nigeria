Seven primary school children died and dozens more were injured when their classroom collapsed on Monday morning in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, a government spokesman said. “So far we can confirm that we have seven fatalities and 57 others are in hospital,” government spokesman Cyrus Oguna said at the scene. Hundreds of angry residents of Dagoretti — a poor area where many live in makeshift houses — swarmed around the site where rescuers picked through the rubble of the classroom.
