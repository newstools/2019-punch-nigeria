Abiodun Nejo A middle aged man and commercial motorcyclist, Sunday Olorunleke, was on Saturday morning found in a pool of blood in his residence at the Aba area of Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital. Sources said the father of two was alone at home when the unknown assailants allegedly struck and hacked him to death. The wife and children of the deceased, who were said to have travelled out of Ado Ekiti since Wednesday, returned on Saturday morning and met him dead. A source said, “The incident was suspected to have happened between Thursday and Friday night. The man was sighted in the neighbourhood on Thursday morning. The wife of the deceased put a call across to some of the neighbours on Thursday when she could not reach her husband on the phone and they informed her that they saw him that very day.” READ ALSO: Varsity student killers not our members–Ganzalo, state vigilance group commander The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Caleb Ikechukwu, who confirmed the killing, said investigation had begun in a bid to arrest the perpetrators.
