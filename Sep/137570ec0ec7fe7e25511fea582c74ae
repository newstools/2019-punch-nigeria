Friday Olokor, Abuja The Nigeria Labour Congress on Tuesday stated that it would support any position taken by the Public Service Negotiating Council at its meeting on the new national minimum wage scheduled for September 4. The President of  the NLC, Ayuba Wabba, said this on the sidelines of the inauguration of the International Lawyers Assisting Workers in Abuja. Recall that organised labour in Nigeria have been in conflict with the Federal Government over the implementation of the new minimum wage that was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on April 18. Wabba explained that once they were able to take a definite decision, the NLC would support the decision. “Whatever will be the outcome, we hope it will be favourable but where they need to take decision, the labour centre will support whatever decision they take.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
