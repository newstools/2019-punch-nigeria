Ada Wodu, Calabar The Deputy Registrar (College of Medicine), University of Calabar, Mrs Hannah Oboho, has allegedly been kidnapped. Sources said Oboho was kidnapped from her home in the early hours of Saturday. Details of the incident were sketchy as of the time of filing this report. When contacted on Sunday, the Public Relations Officer of the university, Mr Effiong Eyo, said he was just returning from a trip and had been informed of the incident through a text message sent by the victim’s son. “I just came into town. I will see the Chief Security Officer tomorrow (Monday). I only learnt from a text sent by the son that she was kidnapped from her home,” Eyo stated in a text message sent to our correspondent. The state Commissioner of Police, Austin Agbonlahor, told our correspondent on the telephone, “We are doing something about it,” adding that kidnapping was a sensitive issue and it was not every strategy of the police that had to be disclosed.
