Oladimeji Ramon A former Minister of Health, Prof Eyitayo Lambo, has described his time in office, during ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration, as very successful. He listed the National Health Insurance Scheme; the National Blood Transfusion Service; and the refurbishment and re-equipping of teaching hospitals in the country as some of his achievements in office. Lambo said he was able to achieve this much because he embraced transparency and had a clear vision for the health sector which was shared by not only the President but also the stakeholders in the health sector. A statement on Thursday quoted Lambo, who served between 2003 and 2007, to have spoken in Abuja at the 55th Annual Scientific Conference and workshop of the Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists of Nigeria. The statement added, “The former minister said he recorded much of the achievements ascribed to him because his vision for the health sector was shared by the leadership and members of the professional groups that worked with him.” Copyright PUNCH.
