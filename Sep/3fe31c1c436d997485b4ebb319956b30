Dayo Ojerinde The Secretary-General of the United Nation, António Guterres, on Monday welcomed the UN political declaration on universal health coverage which commits countries to advance towards full coverage for their citizens in four major areas around primary health care. During a meeting of heads of state, ministers, health leaders, policy-makers, and universal health coverage champions, Guterres called UHC the most comprehensive agreement ever reached on global health – a vision for Universal Health Coverage by 2030. Guterres added that robust and resilient primary health care systems would address non-communicable disease and the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance. .Copyright PUNCH.
