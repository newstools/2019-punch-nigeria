Enyioha Opara, Minna THE Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, has ordered enforcement of law prohibiting indiscriminate parking of trailers and tankers along major highways across the state to reduce carnage on roads. Bello gave the order on Sunday when he commiserated with victims of a tanker explosion that occurred along theÂ  Abuja-Kaduna highway on Friday. He bemoaned the activities of tanker and trailer drivers who park illegally by the roadside, and warned that the state government would no longer condone such illegalities. Copyright PUNCH.
