Boko Haram insurgents on Thursday opened fire on the convoy of the Governor of Borno State, Babagana Zulum. The incident was said to have happened around 9pm. According to TheCable, security sources said the insurgents attacked the convoy in Konduga while Zulum was returning from a trip to the Bama Local Government Area. Zulum had visited Bayo, Kwaya Kusar, Askira Uba and Gwoza as part of his “familiarity and need assessment tour” of the 27 LGAs in the state. The source said, “Luckily the governor, his commissioners and other vehicles in the convoy escaped unhurt but the last vehicle which is an army gun truck was pelted with bullets. “Immediately after they fired at us, our men in collaboration with the armed personnel from the Federal Special Anti Robbery Squad, retaliated and thwarted the ambush.” [READ ALSO] Ban: I’m facing most trying period, says Siasia Konduga, an area near Sambisa forest, has come under many attacks from the faction of Boko Haram under the control of Abubakar Shekau. The attack comes seven months after Kashim Shettima, Zulum’s successor was attacked by the sect on his way to Gamboru Ngala, still in Borno.
