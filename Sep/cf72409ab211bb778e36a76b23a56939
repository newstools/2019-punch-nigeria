Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt The RIVERS State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said the mobile courts for the task force against street trading, illegal markets and motor parks will become operational  on Monday (today). Speaking with officials of the task force at the Government House in Port Harcourt on Sunday, Wike said the magistrates would be deployed in various locations on Monday. He said, “From tomorrow (today), magistrates  will sit at the various locations to prosecute offenders of the law banning street trading. “Your business is to arrest the offenders in line with the law and take them to the magistrates for trial. Anyone who is guilty will be sanctioned by the magistrates.” He warned officials of the task force against taking the law into their own hands, stating that the state government would not tolerate them manhandling any offender. “We don’t want to see any street traders anywhere in Port Harcourt. Your duty is to ensure that the streets are clean. “Those selling corn and other items on the roads should also leave. If you want to be a trader, kindly move into the markets,” he said.
