Ade Adesomoju, Abuja Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja is to rule later on Tuesday on the request to order the release of the convener of #RevolutionNow protest, Mr. Omoyele Sowore, from the custody of the Department of State Service. The judge stood down the case after hearing arguments from legal teams of Sowore and the DSS. Leading Sowore’s team, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), noted that the order issued by the court on August 8, 2019 permitting the DSS to hold the activist for 45 days, had expired on September 21.

But responding, DSS’ lawyer, G.O Agbadua, said that since the charges had been filed against the activist on September 20, it was lawful to continue to keep him until arraignment. But Falana said, “Filing of charges cannot metamorphose into a detention order. “A citizen cannot detain a citizen in anticipation of arraignment.”
