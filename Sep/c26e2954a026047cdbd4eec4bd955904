A twitter user, Neeraj Agrawal, on Tuesday, said that an entire company was locked out of its workspace for two days after an umbrella fell and jammed the sliding door of the office. Agrawal, who is based in Washington DC said that the company involved was that of his friend and that they use a co-sharing office space operated by WeWork. Alongside a photo of the jammed door, Agrawal tweeted, “My friend’s entire company is locked out of their WeWork office because an umbrella fell, jamming the door. No one can figure it out. It’s been like this for two days.” He added, “The number of people who have said they should just break the glass today is astonishing. There’s nothing important in there. It’s 2019. Computers are portable now. Work just moved to a different office. No one is going to smash a pane of glass if they can avoid it.” READ ALSO: Osinbajo’s office has been rendered useless, impotent —Afenifere His tweet generated a lot of solutions from Twitter users, some of which included, “Take the door off” “Go through the drop ceiling” “Slip something through the crack” and “Use a magnet.” Giving an update on Wednesday, Agrawal said that the co-sharing firm had sent in an engineer, who drilled a hole in the ceiling and dropped a wire, which eventually solved the problem. He added that that particular solution had not been suggested by social media users. See his tweets:
