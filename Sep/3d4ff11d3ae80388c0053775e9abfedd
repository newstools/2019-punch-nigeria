Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta The Ogun State Government on Wednesday said the Homeowners’ Charter programme, initiated by the past administration led by former Governor Ibikunle Amosun, lacked a reliable database and proper accreditation of beneficiaries. A statement by the state government stated that the Secretary to the Ogun State Government, Mr Olatokunbo Talabi, stated this while featuring on a radio programme in Abeokuta. Talabi was said to have described the initiative as commendable, but insisted that there was an urgent need to re-appraise, identify and proffer lasting solutions to the anomalies of the scheme. Talabi, however, assured beneficiaries of the programme of government’s resolve to review the initiative for optimal benefit to the people and the state in general. He said, “The Dapo Abiodun led-administration on assumption, appraised the viability of the Homeowners Charter and issues were raised, which included lack of reliable database and proper accreditation of beneficiaries. “He also said that the present administration was putting in place a land reform policy and by extension a bill, to address all the challenges associated with land administration in the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
