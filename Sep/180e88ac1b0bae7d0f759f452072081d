Samson Folarin A non-governmental organisation, Project Enable, has called for the protection of the rights of persons living with disabilities, saying everyone owed it a duty to defend them. The Executive Director of the group, Mr Olusola Owonikoko, spoke during the inauguration of the Inclusion Hub and #FollowDisACT campaign. A statement on Tuesday said the initiatives were to push for the full implementation of the Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibitions) Act. According to the statement, the Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability and imposes sanctions, including fines and prison sentences on those who contravene it. Owonikoko said the group desired to strengthen advocacy for Persons Living with Disabilities (PWDs) by enlightening the public on the Act. “The goal of the campaign is to drive and catalyse the implementation of the new Act across Nigeria, while monitoring and reporting its progress and engaging all stakeholders from the private, public and civil society sectors. “Our approach is largely community-driven and will focus on the community of persons with disabilities, promoting their understanding of the provisions of the Act, while also sensitising the society to the legal framework protecting disability rights in Nigeria through the mass media,” he said in the statement. A gender rights activist, Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin, who is also a board member of the NGO, said the campaign would monitor the process of implementation of the Act. Copyright PUNCH.
