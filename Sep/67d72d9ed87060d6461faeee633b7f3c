Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja The Federal Government on Thursday alerted Nigerians to some wrong videos in circulation purportedly depicting the plights of some Nigerians who are said to be victims of xenophobic attacks in South Africa. It cited three of such videos which it said are footage of different incidents which do not involve Nigerians. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said this at a press conference in Abuja. Mohammed urged those circulating the wrong videos to desist from such since such acts were capable of causing more havoc. He also urged opinion leaders and celebrities to watch their words. He also urged Nigerians who he said were justifiably angry to stop carrying out reprisal attacks. The minister also assured all Nigerians and foreigners that the government has put in place proper security measures to ensure the safety of lives and property in the country. He assured all stakeholders that all those who looted properties under the guise of protests would be arrested and prosecuted.
