The Commissioner for Basic and Secondary Education in Delta State, Chief Patrick Ukah, has said that the recruitment of 1,000 teachers into the Post Primary Education Board was to bridge the gap in the number of teachers in public schools in the state. In a statement by the Public Relations Officer of the ministry, Mr Oghenero Orovwuje, in Asaba on Friday, Ukah was quoted as saying this when he visited the venue of the screening of successful candidates for employment as teachers into the PPEB. Ukah said Governor Ifeanyi Okowa was determined to ensure that the education sector attained a level where students from public schools in the state would compete favourably with their peers around the world. While describing the recruitment process as transparent and devoid of lobbying, he admonished the successful candidates to be diligent in their duties and bring the knowledge they had in their various fields of study to bear on their performance.
