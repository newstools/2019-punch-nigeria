He said this during plenary on Wednesday, a statement signed by Ezrel Tabiowo, Special Assistant (Press) to the President of the Senate says. Lawan said, “Our petroleum industry is almost stagnant and for long needing profound reform. Our oil and gas-related committees are therefore expected to work hard to take the lead in our determination to reform this vital sector. It is the desire, indeed the design of this Senate that, the Petroleum Industry Bill is passed before the end of 2020.” READ ALSO: Senate receives MTEF, FSP documents from Buhari Speaking on insecurity in the nation, Lawan said,  “The security architecture of our country has not achieved the desired results of providing the needed security to our citizens. Our security agencies need better funding and other resources for better performance. “As security is a fundamental responsibility of government, no amount of investment is too much. Our security-related committees are therefore challenged to assess and review both the architecture and structure of our security agencies towards improved efficiency.”
