Ademola Babalola, Ibadan Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Monday hailed the new rapport between the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji and his high chiefs. Makinde while observing protocols at the South West geopolitical zone security summit which had Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun state; the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu; and representatives of other governors in attendance, commended the presence of Olubadan and his chiefs. The Governor said, “I am happy that high chiefs accompanied Kabiyesi, Olubadan to this event.” The audience roared in wild jubilation as they looked in the direction of the smiling chiefs and the elated monarch.
