Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Police Command says it has commenced investigation into the alleged kidnap and extortion of rapper, Ikechukwu Onunaku, by some of its operatives attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. The rapper had last week Thursday accused the SARS operatives of beating and robbing him of his money in the Lekki Phase 1 area of the state. Narrating his ordeal on his Instagram page, Ikechukwu alleged that he was pulled out from an Uber taxi, bundled into a police Hilux van and beaten by the operatives. According to him, the operatives drove him to the Lagos Island and forced him to withdraw all the money in his account after threatening to implicate him if he proved stubborn. Reacting, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, had urged the rapper to come forward with facts about the incident and that investigation would commence into it. When PUNCH Metro contacted the PPRO on Thursday, he said the command had commenced investigation into the matter. “We have commenced investigation into the incident; he has stepped forward with some facts, which are helping us with our investigation; so, we are still investigating,” Elkana stated. When our correspondent asked if the cops involved had been identified or arrested, the PPRO declined making further comments. Attempts to contact the rapper were frustrated by him as he refused to pick his telephone calls at first, and when he eventually picked, he asked our correspondent to call him back, but subsequent calls were not picked.
