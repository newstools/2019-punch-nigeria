Budgit co-founder, Seun Onigbinde, has been appointed as a Technical Adviser in the Ministry of Budget and National Planning. Communication Associate of Budgit, Shakir Akorede, confirmed the news to The PUNCH on Friday in a telephone conversation. He said, while the news was true, it had nothing to do with Budgit which is still dedicated to holding government accountable. Akorede said, “It’s true, however, I need to point out that this has nothing to do with Budgit. As you may recall, Seun has been absent from the company for some time. This is a situation that affects Seun as a person, nothing to do with Budgit.
