Tony Okafor, Awka The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has asked the United Nations to prevail on President Muhammadu Buhari to release the convener of #Revolution now#, Omoyele Sowore and the Shiites leader, Sheikh El-Zakzaky. IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said the demand formed part of the issues Kanu raised in a meeting with UN agencies recently. Powerful added that the issue of rural grazing area, otherwise known as RUGA, was also raised in the meeting. He said Kanu’s struggle to liberate his people had grown beyond Nigeria, adding that the issues were before the various arms and agencies of the United Nations. He said, “Biafra’s case will no longer be ignored; it has been internationalised.” He said Kanu demanded urgent action against the numerous rights abuses inflicted on his people and the need to support the undeniable right of the Biafran people to self-determination as enshrined in laws, statutes and UN conventions. The statement read in part, “Every issue concerning our people is now before the various arms and agencies of the United Nations. Our case will no longer be ignored. “The case of RUGA settlement was also raised in the meeting.
