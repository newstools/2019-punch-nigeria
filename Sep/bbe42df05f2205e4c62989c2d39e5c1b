Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Monday called on the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to accelerate the process of giving approval to the State’s request to build two seaports in Lekki and Badagry. The Governor said the State had already deployed resources and manpower in the construction of the seaports, which, he said, were being initiated to complement the capacities of the existing ports in Apapa and Tin Can Island. Sanwo-Olu spoke while receiving members of the House of Representatives Ad-Hoc Committee on Ports Decongestion led by Hon. Yusuf Buba Yakub, said Lagos needed two additional ports which would serve the State and also build the national economy. He said, “Lagos needs to have two other ports which would not only serve us but also build the national economy. We have initiated the development of Lekki seaport, which has started. We are building another port in Badagry. “But, we are still in conversation with the NPA to grant the approval, because we have added five developers, financiers, and partners on the Badagry port. If we can finish the construction of both seaports, it would free up the congestion in the Apapa axis and create a new business hub for our people.” The Governor said the Federal Government’s move to grow the non-oil sector and boost the economy would be rewarding if the capacities of the existing seaports were efficiently maximised. He pointed out the need to enhance the efficiency of the Apapa and Tin Can Island seaports for improved non-oil revenue generation, stressing that the decongestion of the two ports was long overdue. Sanwo-Olu said his visit to the two Lagos ports within 48 hours after he assumed office was an indication of the strategic role the two seaports were playing in sustaining the state’s 24-hour economy.
