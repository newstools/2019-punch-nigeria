On his part, Aliyu said that he threw the baby into the river out of frustration as his mother and the mother of his girlfriend, who bore the child for him, never liked the baby. He said his mother gets mad at him any time she thinks of the baby and even threatened to lay a curse on him if he ever brought the baby to their house. “My girlfriend is always crying that her mother doesn’t like the baby and that the mother said she would stop taking care of the baby until we get married. “My own mum also doesn’t like the baby and keeps saying she would curse me if I bring the child home,” “This was what made me take the baby in my arms one day, cried for 30 minutes and threw him into River Oti,” he added According to him, he regrets what he did and is prepared to face the consequences of his action.
