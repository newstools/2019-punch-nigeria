Mudiaga Affe The Partnership Initiative in the Niger Delta Foundation on Friday said it had trained 200 youths in Edo State on renewable energy. The Manager, Appropriate Technology Enabled Development of PIND Foundation, Dr Teslin Giwa, in a statement on Friday said the youths were trained on how to operate, install and maintain small to medium solar PV technology solutions and project management. He said this during the graduation ceremony of the beneficiaries held at the Edo Production Centre. The training which lasted for one month was done in collaboration with the Edo State government and the Skills Development for Youth Empowerment. Giwa said the training was to make the youths entrepreneurs and solve the problem of electricity in the country due to incessant failure of electricity providers. He said the youths would be given a starter pack to go into the business and in turn, become employers of labour in the various skills acquired. He said, “light is very important to human existence and these youths have been trained to be industrious and establish their businesses to provide solar energy for Nigerians especially this era of powers failure.” Edo State Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Empowerment, Mr Felix Akhabue, said the state government supported the initiative because of its resolve to empower Edo youths.
