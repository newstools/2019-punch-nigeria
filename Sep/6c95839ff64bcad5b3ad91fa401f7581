Samson Folarin The Lagos State Government has revealed plans to reintroduce the monthly sanitation and the restriction on movement in the state. The Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, said the enabling law for the reintroduction of the monthly exercise was on the way. Bello spoke during a stakeholders’ meeting with the Association of Commodity Market Women and Men led by the Iyaloja General of Nigeria, Folasade Tinubu-Ojo. According to a statement on Wednesday, Bello said the invalidation of the exercise by a court sometime ago was a temporary setback which would be reversed soon. He noted in the statement that the meeting was convened to seek the buy-in of market leaders, women and men and show government’s zero tolerance for indiscriminate dumping of waste. The statement read in part, “Bello asked markets in the state which had yet to engage the services of PSP waste operators to link up with the Lagos State Waste Management Authority and ensure that no form of waste was taken to the roads thenceforth. “He stated that in conjunction with the appointed PSP waste operators, a point within a market must be identified where all the waste generated should be gathered before being taken away by the PSP operator. “The commissioner assured the market leaders that the state would not hesitate to sanction PSP operators who failed to perform their duties appropriately.” Tinubu-Ojo, in her response, said she would ensure that market sanitation became a daily task that all market leaders would adopt.
