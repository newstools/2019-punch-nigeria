Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi Toyota has indicated interest in investing in the automobile, energy and healthcare sectors of Nigeriaâ€™s economy, the Federal Government has said. The President and Chief Executive Officer of the Toyota Group, Ichiro Kashitani, said the group would be delighted to have presence all over Nigeria. A statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, quoted Kashitani to have made this known during a bilateral meeting with Toyota Tsusho, a part of the Toyota conglomerate. Kashitani said Toyota Tsusho wished to also build an advanced medical diagnostics centre, which would foreclose need for foreign travel to obtain cutting-edge medical diagnosis, according to the statement. The statement said President Muhammadu Buhari held investment talks with top officials of Japan Bank for International Cooperation and Toyota Group at the recently held Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development in Yokohama, Japan.
