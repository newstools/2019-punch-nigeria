Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A 58-year-old man, Olaniyi Olusegun, was on Friday arraigned before an Osun State Magistratesâ€™ Court sitting in Osogbo for stealing the sum of N7,246,971. The money, it was learnt, belonged to the Afenifere Cooperative Investment and Credit Union Limited, Okinni. According to the charge, the offences of conspiracy and stealing were committed between 2013 and 2017 in Okinni. The offences were said to be contrary to and punishable under sections 516 and 390 (9) of the Criminal Code, Cap 34 Vol. 2, Laws of Osun State of Nigeria, 2002. Olusegun pleaded not guilty when the charges were read to him. The counsel for the accused, Mrs Basirat Moshood, applied for bail on behalf of her client, but the prosecutor, Taiwo Adegoke, opposed the application. Adegoke said the accused and one other person arrested in connection with the matter were granted an administrative bail by the police when the audit of the account had yet to be concluded. He said the accused jumped bail, adding that the persistence of the Investigating Police Officer in charge of the case led to his rearrest. He also told the court that the amount involved was huge, stressing that Olusegun might jump bail again if granted bail by the court. Magistrate Olusegun Ayilara, in his ruling, ordered that the accused be remanded in prison custody and adjourned the case till October 4, 2019, for ruling. .Copyright PUNCH.
