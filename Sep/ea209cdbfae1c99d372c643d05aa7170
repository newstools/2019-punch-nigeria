A gang of thieves on Saturday stole an 18-carat gold toilet from an art exhibition at Britain’s Blenheim Palace, police said — causing flooding to the World Heritage Site. The fully-functioning piece by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, dubbed “America”, was once displayed at New York’s Guggenheim museum and offered on loan to US President Donald Trump. A 66-year-old man has been arrested over the theft at the 18th-century stately home in Oxfordshire,  where an exhibition of Cattelan works opened on Thursday. “The offenders broke into the palace overnight and left the scene at about 4:50 a.m. (0350 GMT). No-one was injured during the burglary,” local police said.

The palace is home to the 12th duke of Marlborough and his family, and was also the birthplace of British wartime leader Winston Churchill. (AFP)
