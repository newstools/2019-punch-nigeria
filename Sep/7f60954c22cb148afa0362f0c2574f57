The FCT Directorate of Road Traffic Services, popularly known as VIO, says it has impounded no fewer than 65 unworthy vehicles plying the Federal Capital City roads. The Director of the traffic services, Malam Wadata Bodinga, made the disclosure while briefing journalists on Friday in Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Bodinga explained the DRTS officials with the support of police arrested the vehicles following their owners’ failure to heed to the rules. According to him,  the directorate will not tolerate motorists that operate in the city as commercial vehicles without painting or due registration. “We will not accept vehicles without due registration to operate in Abuja, some are rickety ones and we can not allow them to operate in the territory.” Bodinga said the vehicles were impounded at Federal Secretariat, Ministry of Finance Junction, Area II and around Office of the Head of service. He said that the operation was aimed at addressing reported cases of ‘one chance’  in and around the territory, and also a renewed fight against activities of suspected criminals that have been terrorising innocent residents. “This exercise is informed by the incessant complaints by the residents on the issue of one chance menace, so the arrest of the unpainted vehicles will help in checkmating the suspected criminal activities of one chance people.”
