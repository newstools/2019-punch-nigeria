Peter Dada,  Akure Three students of the Ondo State School of Health Technology, Akure, were on Monday, arraigned before a magistrates’ court sitting in the state capital for alleged rape and other crimes. The accused persons are Damilola Adeboboye, Blessing Michael and Charles Eyitayo. The trio were arrested by the men of the state police command last week for allegedly gang-raping a female student of the institution at the Barrister Lodge, Olofinlade Layout, Oda Road, Akure. Prior to the incident, the accused persons were also alleged to have raped a student of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, and attempted to have carnal knowledge of another victim. The defendants were also alleged to have robbed one Segun Israel and one Foluso Adedayo of their money, mobile telephones and laptops at gunpoint. The accused were arraigned on eight counts bordering on armed robbery, rape, illegal possession of firearms and cultism. The police prosecutor, Mr Abdulateef Suleiman, asked the court to remand the accused persons in prison custody, but the counsel for the defendants, Mr Banjo Ayelakin and Mr Olutoye Adeyanju, objected to the application, arguing that they were served the application few hours before the court proceedings. They prayed the court to adjourn the case to enable them study the application properly. In her ruling, the magistrate, Mrs Victoria Bob-Manuel, adjourned the case till September 5, 2019, for mention. The magistrate ordered the remand of the accused persons in police custody.
