Peter Dada, Akure The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the  sacking  of a member of the Ondo State House of Assembly representing Okitipupa Constituency 2  Mr  Sina Akinwumi. Akinwumi is a member of the All Progressives Congress. Ondo State High Court and the Court of Appeal in Akure had earlier nullified the primary election that produced him  as the candidate of the  APC for the  March 9  House of Assembly election, ruling in favour of  James Ololade-Gbegudu. The apex court panel headed  by Justice Mary Peter-Odili unanimously  ordered the issuance of the certificate of return to Ololade-Gbegudu by the Independent National Electoral Commission as the authentic lawmaker representing the constituency for winning the APC primary. The court also ordered the Speaker  and Clerk of the  Assembly  to immediately swear in  Ololade-Gbegudu. The litigation started when   Ololade-Gbegudu approached the High Court through his counsel, Mr Femi Emodamori, seeking  an order  compelling  the APC and INEC to recognise him as the authentic APC candidate for the constituency, having won the party’s primary conducted on October 5, 2018. The lower court on May 15, 2019 declared  Ololade-Gbegudu the winner of the  primary conducted The court of Appeal also confirmed his victory in July. But  Akinwumi challenged the verdicts of the lower courts at the Supreme Court but lost again. Copyright PUNCH.
