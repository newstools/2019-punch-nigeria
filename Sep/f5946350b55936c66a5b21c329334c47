We are never averse to payment of loans under the legal environment and we don’t want a situation that will put our financial system in jeopardy. “However, governors believe that we are ready to pay, we also have a duty to ensure reconciliation of account as far as monies owed to states may be concerned. “It is a storm in a teacup when we read about governors refusing to pay. We don’t have such an issue, we are ready to pay.
