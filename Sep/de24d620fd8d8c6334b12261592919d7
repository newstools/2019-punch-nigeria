Satellite pictures recently emerged showed the Grace 1 tanker, also called the Adrian Darya 1, approaching a port in Syria. Sky News reports that the foreign secretary has condemned Iran for a breach of “assurances” after it delivered its oil to Syria using the controversial Grace 1 tanker. Dominic Raab issued a statement after satellite pictures emerged showing the tanker, also called the Adrian Darya 1, approaching a port in Syria. In July, the ship was impounded by Gibraltar after British Royal Marines abseiled onto the vessel and took its crew into custody over concerns it would break sanctions on Syria by delivering Iranian oil to President Assad’s regime. But it was later released when officials received a promise from Tehran that the tanker would not go there. An angry statement from the Foreign Office said it was “now clear that Iran has breached these assurances and that the oil has been transferred to Syria and Assad’s murderous regime”. It said the Iranian ambassador had been summoned to explain the “unacceptable violation of international norms”, and that the UK would be raising the issue at the United Nations later this month. Mr Raab added: “This sale of oil to Assad’s brutal regime is part of a pattern of behaviour by the government of Iran designed to disrupt regional security.
