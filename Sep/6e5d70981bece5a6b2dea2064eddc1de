Peter Dada, Akure Seventy-two hours after the death of a lecturer in the Department of Mathematical Science, Ondo State University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa, Ondo State, Prof Gideon Okedayo, the labour unions in the institution on Wednesday called on President Muhammadu Buhari to fish out the perpetrators of the dastardly act. Okedayo, who was abducted by some gunmen last week, was reportedly found dead on Sunday a few metres away from where he was kidnapped. The labour unions of the university, which included the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities, Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities and the National Association of Academic Technologists, said the incident happened as a result of the failure of the government to provide adequate security for the people of the country. Speaking on behalf of the unions, the chairman of Joint Action Committee of Staff Unions of the Osustech, Mr Temidayo Temola, also blamed the security agencies in Edo State for not being proactive enough to rescue the lecturer. He said, “He did not in any way deserve this in a country that he diligently served. We charge the Federal Government and security agencies to go after the killers of Prof Okedayo, and bring them to book. “We also call on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately overhaul the security apparatus in the country. Nigerians deserve a safer ambience in their own land.” Also, the Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, condemned the murder of the late professor, describing it as heinous and barbaric. In a statement issued by Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity , Mr Ojo Oyewamide, the governor also described it as a great loss to the nation and the academic community. Copyright PUNCH.
