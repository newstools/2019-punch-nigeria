Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum has picked holes in the National Livestock Transformation Plan, describing it as RUGA in disguise. Rising from its meeting in Abuja on Wednesday, the SMBLF expressed its opposition to NLTP in a statement issued on Thursday by its spokespersons, Yinka Odumakin (South West), Prof. Chigozie Ogbu (South East), Senator Bassey Henshaw (South South), and Dr Isuwa Dogo (Middle Belt). The communiqué read, “Meeting restates the rejection of the use of the collective resources of Nigerians for herdsmen, majority of whom are non-Nigerians, from nomadic to sedentary lifestyles while doing their private business that has nothing to do with the rest of us beyond being their market. “It is akin to government making budgetary allocations to Coca-Cola to produce drinks to sell to Nigerians.” The SMBLF, comprising political pressure groups from the South-West, South-East and the Middle Belt regions, stated that it would not accept the policy, arguing that herdsmen should rather set up ranches on their own. “The entire plan is meant to benefit only cattle and herdsmen; we do not accept the policy and we ask the Federal Government to allow those who are in cattle business to establish ranches on their own under the guidelines and laws of the host state,” the group stated. It also opposed the water bill, which it described as a ploy to take away the natural resources of Nigerians and called on southern lawmakers to resist it. Copyright PUNCH.
