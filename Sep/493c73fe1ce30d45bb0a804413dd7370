Godwin Isenyo The Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria hailed   Governor Nasir el-Rufai over the state  government’s decision  not to  demolish the 110-year-old St George’s  Anglican Church, Zaria. The CAN Chairman in the state, Rev Joseph Hayab, told  our correspondent on the telephone  that they were happy with  Friday’s  clarification by the Director-General of the Kaduna State Urban Planning Development Agency, Ismail Dikko, that the church wouldn’t be demolished because of its historical value. The KASUPDA was said to have served the church demolition notice. Following Thursday’s protest by  CAN, the KASUPDA decided to spare the church. “The church will remain based on its historical value,” the DG had said. Hayab  commended el-Rufai for shelving demolition plan. He said  democracy could thrive only when  the government listened to the people. The CAN leader said, “We commend the government for this act. What we are saying is that government  should remain a listening government. “What we are doing is simply to remind government that we are not at war with them. We are just raising  the alarm. “So, if they do good, we will clap for them,  but if they don’t, we will tell them that something is wrong and that people are crying.” Copyright PUNCH.
