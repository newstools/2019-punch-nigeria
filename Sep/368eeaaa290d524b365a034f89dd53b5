Patrick Odey, Uyo The Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly on Tuesday reinstated the suspended chairman of Abak Local Government Area of the state, Mr. Imoh Williams. The reinstatement takes effect from Tuesday, September 17, 2019. The Speaker of the Assembly, Mr Aniekan Bassey,  announced the reinstatement at plenary after the committee on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs headed by Mr  Mark Eset, discovered that no case of abuse of office was established against him. The  House had on Thursday, July 25, suspended the Abak Council Chairman, and mandated the Vice-Chairman, Mrs Benita Ukpe to take over the affairs of the council, pending the investigation and report of the committee. The committee recommended that the personal assistant, Mr  Uduakobong Ekpo, who allegedly assaulted the artisan, Godwin Abraham,  tender an apology to him and advised the chairman to guard against overzealousness amongst his aides. The report of the committee read in part, “The chairman, Imoh Williams should train his aides against overzealousness and brazen act of impunity and that the suspended Abak LG chairman should be reinstated with effect from Tuesday, Sept. 17, as no case of abuse of office was established against him.”
