The  Peoples Democratic Party has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to accept the “bitter truth” in the report of the UN Rapporteur, Agnes Callamard. In a statement issued by the party, available via its verified Twitter handle, PDP said “The PDP counsels President Buhari to show humility and accept the bitter truth that poverty, internal conflicts, bloodletting, banditry, kidnapping, insurgency, abuse of human rights and general national insecurity have escalated under his divisive, vindictive and repressive administration. “The party says instead of embarking on ego trip and picking a fight with the UN Rapporteur, Agnes Callamard for highlighting the grave security issues in our country, which are already in the international domain, the Buhari Presidency should be seeking for help, seeing that its has no solution to the festering problem. “If anything, the UN Rapporteur report only reinforces the positions of credible international bodies including the United States Department of State, Amnesty and Anticorruption, which also reported cases of arbitrary and extra-judicial killings, illegal arrests, arbitrary detention, torture, festering violence, reported disappearances and abuse of human rights under the Buhari administration. “Moreover, the PDP holds that the UN report is a vindication of its stance as well as that of millions of Nigerians that the ineptitude and repressive tendencies of the APC administration under President Buhari are emboldening acts on violence and fuelling impunity, division and intolerance in the polity.
