Oladimeji Ramon The immediate-past Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has described as misleading the report that he and his deputy, Ike Ekweremadu, failed to retire N73.5bn running cost. His media aide, Yusuph Olaniyonu, said contrary to the media report (not by The PUNCH), before leaving office on June 6, 2019 “Saraki duly retired all funds allocated as running costs to his office as President of the Senate between June 2015  and May 2019.” Olaniyonu said his principal was, indeed, issued with a Certificate of Retirement “in acknowledgement of the fact that Dr Saraki has fully complied with relevant laws, rules and regulations in respect of the use and retirement of such funds.” Copyright PUNCH.
