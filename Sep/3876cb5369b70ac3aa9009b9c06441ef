Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The Otukpo Government Secondary School Old Boys Association has urged the Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Sen. George Akume, to intervene in the ethnic clashes between the Tiv and Jukun ethnic groups of Taraba State. The President, Paul Edeh, made the call during a visit to the former Benue State governor on his appointment as a minister by President Muhammadu Buhari. Akume was a pioneer pupil of the school. He graduated in 1971. Edeh said, “We use this occasion to call on Your Excellency to take border crisis between the two states as well as the Tiv/Jukun crisis as the first project of your ministry and provide a lasting and enduring solution.” Responding, Akume, who observed that there were desperate efforts to undermine the integrity of the country, said the administration would ensure peace and security in the country. He added that the herders and farmers clashes would soon be a thing of the past. Copyright PUNCH.
