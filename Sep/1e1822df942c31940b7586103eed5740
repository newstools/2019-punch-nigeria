Dr. Solomon Gembeh, High Commissioner of Sierra Leone to Nigeria has said that the implementation of the Economic Community of West Africa State single currency will reduce the dependency of member states on the west. Gembeh gave the view in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Saturday in Abuja. He called on member states to work towards meeting the implementation deadline of the single currency “Eco” which, he said, was already a threat to Western countries. According to the Sierra Leonean envoy, West Africa is blessed with a lot of minerals, natural resources and human resources which, if effectively harnessed, will make the region a trade destination for Western Countries.

It is from here they take them and send it to the west. “We have oil, diamonds, gold, all our natural resources, agriculture and land to feed ourselves, we don’t need the west. “At the end, Africa is where the next generation is going to be so why would you want to go to US? “In Sierra Leone we have our natural resources and if you start trading among each other you do not need to go to the West. “For vacation, you can go to Bon Island in Sierra Leone, which is like a French Riviera, and so, the Single currency is a threat to the west, it is the way to go,” Gembeh said.
