Sola Shittu, Benin Gunmen on Friday kidnapped two  Nigeria Security and Civil Defence officers  while on their way to Benin from the northern part of Edo State. The  development came three days after the wife of the Managing Director of the Nigeria Railway Corporation  was kidnapped in the state. Francis Okunwe,  who is the Area Commander of the Edo North Area Command, and  the Divisional Officer of Irrua, Chief Superintended of Corps Albert Eguavoen, were said to have been abducted  at Ewosaa  before  Ebele in Igueben Local Government Area of the state at about 2pm. The state Commissioner of Police, Danmallam Mohammed,  who confirmed the incident,  said they were on the trail of their abductors. It was learnt that  the officers  were forced to divert to Igueben road because of the sorry  state of the Benin-Auchi-Okenne road. A source said,  “The Toyota Sienna  they were travelling in has been recovered from where it was abandoned, while some  NSCDC  officers  have been deployed in  the area. “They were on their way to Benin but because of the bad portion along  the Auchi-Benin- Okenne road, they decided to pass through Igueben to cut off the bad spots. But unfortunately the incident happened around Ewossa before Ekpon.” Spokesman for  the corps in the state, Efosa Ogbebor,  could not confirm the incident. Copyright PUNCH.
