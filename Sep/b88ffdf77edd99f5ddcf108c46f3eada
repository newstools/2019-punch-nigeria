Maiharaji Altine, Gusau A ghastly motor accident involving a petrol tanker and a Peugeot 307 has claimed several lives along the Gusau-Zaria Road in Zamfara State on Friday. Our Correspondent reports that the accident happened around 7.30am. The two vehicles burst into flames immediately the collision occurred,  and all the passengers, except one, were burnt beyond recognition. Firefighters were at the scene of the accident trying to put out the fire at the time of filing this report. Vehicular movement on that axis was also at a standstill. Although a team of Mobile Policemen and soldiers were later deployed in the scene of the accident to control traffic, motorists still found it difficult to move due to the heavy traffic.
