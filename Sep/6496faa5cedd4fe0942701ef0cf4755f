Ortom, while inaugurating the new appointees at the new banquet hall of the Government House, Makurdi, charged them to be good ambassadors of his administration and conduct themselves in an exemplary manner. Ortom said, “You have been fairly chosen based on the leadership qualities found in you and your capacity coupled with your quest to deliver quality service, which you are known for based on your antecedents. “Your coming is to help us bring democratic dividends to the doorsteps of the people. Therefore, you must shun all activities capable of denting the image of this government. If you are found wanting, I will not hesitate to sack you.” Copyright PUNCH.
