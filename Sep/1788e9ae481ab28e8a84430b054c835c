Peter Dada, Akure A lecturer in the department of Mathematical Science of the Ondo State University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa, Ondo State, Prof. Gideon Okedayo, has been reportedly kidnapped by some gunmen. It was gathered that the incident happened around 6.30pm when the victim was travelling to Igara in Kogi State on Thursday. The kidnappers have not contacted the family at the time of this report. The Chairman, Joint Action Committee of Staff Unions in OSUSTECH, Mr. Dayo Temola, confirmed the incident on Friday. The labour leader called on the state police command and the state government to assist in rescuing the victim. Temola said, “With utmost shock and disbelief we received the news of reported kidnapping of Professor Gideon Okedayo. He is a thorough-bred academic who has and is still contributing to the growth of education in Nigeria and beyond. “We therefore think that in all honesty, he deserves no place in this heinous act of man’s inhumanity to man. We hereby call on the government and relevant security agencies to fast-track his unconditional release. “The security agencies on our road should be proactive and go beyond routine check and wrangling of innocent citizens.” The Police Public Relations Officer of the state command, Mr. Femi Joseph, confirmed the incident but said “it did not happen within our jurisdiction.” Copyright PUNCH.
