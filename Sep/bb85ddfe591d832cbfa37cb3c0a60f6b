Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja. Global rights group, Amnesty International has lambasted the Federal government for charging Sahara Reporters publisher, Omoyele Sowore, with treason and insulting the President. AI, in a series of tweets on Saturday, described the move as dictatorial and unwarranted. It called on the government to immediately release him and drop all the charges. It said, “Amnesty International condemns the bizarre charges pressed on activist Omoyele for expressing his views in media interviews. “The trumped-up charges he is facing show an attempt by the Nigerian authorities to deprive him of his human rights. “Sowore’s continued incarceration on the application of the Terrorism Act for exercising his right to freedom of expression is a misuse of the criminal system to silence dissent. “We call on the Nigerian authorities to respect and protect the human rights of all persons without discrimination and ensure that it does not use its laws to justify violations of Sowore’s human rights.”
