Ademola Babalola, Ibadan The Otun Olubadan of Ibadanland, High Chief Lekan Balogun, on Wednesday, disclosed that removal of their crowns was not part of the ongoing reconciliation with the Olubadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji. Speaking with The PUNCH, Balogun who was elevated to a crown-wearing oba alongside 20 others, at a ceremony of August 27, 2017 by former Governor Abiola Ajimobi, maintained that only the court could stop them from wearing the crowns. A news report had on Tuesday reported that the high chiefs had given up their crowns in deference to the supremacy of the Olubadan. But Balogun, who said he had always held Olubadan in high esteem and revered him as a father, said, “We didn’t give ourselves crowns. We were made kings by the law and no other law has asked us to stop wearing it.” “Where did they (media) get the idea that we had dropped our crowns from? “Media people are just creating unnecessary crisis in the Olubadan-in-council. “We and the Olubadan did not discuss the issue of our crowns at all. “We even have no right to abandon it (crowns).” But the Olubadan cautioned against inflammatory remarks in the media. The Media Officer to Olubadan, Adeola Oloko, who was evasive in making further comments, simply added, “Let’s allow sleeping dogs to lie.” Copyright PUNCH.
