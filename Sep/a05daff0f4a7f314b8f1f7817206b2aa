Ademola Babalola, Ibadan The Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics at the Oyo State College of Agriculture and Technology, Igbo Ora, Mr Oluyide Opadijo, has asked the state Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, and President Muhammadu Buhari to be alive to their responsibilities of ensuring security in the country. The ASUP chairman spoke after he and five others were released by suspected kidnappers last week. Opadijo and three other employees of the college and one other person were kidnapped penultimate Thursday along the Iseyin-Igbo Ora Road on their way back from a meeting of the Joint Action Committee of unions in all the six Oyo State-owned tertiary institutions, held at the Oke-Ogun Polytechnic, Saki. Opadijo, in a statement on Friday, titled, ‘Thank you message’ said, “On behalf of us, the abductees, I wish to immeasurably appreciate all for solidly standing by us to get us rescued from our captors. “We appreciate your concerns, relentless prayers and prompt financial contributions. We appreciate the quick intervention of the Oyo State Government, Oyo and Ogun states police commands, the gallantry and moral support of the college management, the college unions – ASUP; SSANIP and NASU. “I use this opportunity to appeal to governments at all levels to rejig our security architecture to jealously secure the lives and property of the citizenry. “Oyo State police and all other law enforcement agencies should do more to rid off every nook and cranny of the state, especially in Ibarapa land, of criminal elements,” he said.
