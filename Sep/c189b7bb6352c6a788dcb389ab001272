Kaduna State Government has ordered the dismantling of all security check points on Kaduna-Abuja highway. The directive issued on Wednesday after a meeting of the state Security Council, said that the order also covers Kaduna-Zaria and Kaduna-Birnin Gwari highways. This was contained in a statement by Samuel Aruwan, Commissioner, Internal Security and Home Affairs, made available to the News Agency of Nigeria  in Kaduna. “Citizens are to note that effective immediately, there is no authorized checkpoint on these routes, to and fro, until further notice,” the government said. It warned that anyone found manning checkpoints along the routes would be held for conducting an illegal operation. “Road users are strictly warned not to show compliance with any checkpoint on these routes at this time,” the government added. “The State Security Council wishes to assure the public that the security agencies are conducting operations to rout the criminals and end the menace of banditry on these highways.”
