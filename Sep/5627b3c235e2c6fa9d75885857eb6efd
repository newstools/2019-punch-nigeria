A furniture firm, Classic Entrance, Kaduna, on Saturday, commenced the training of 3,000 Quranic education pupils, popularly known as `Amlajiri’, in furniture making, to empower them with skills to be self-reliant. The initiative, according to Mr Mathew Adejo, the Chief Executive Officer of the firm, is aimed at keeping them busy and off the streets. Adejo, at a ceremony to formally open the training, said that the scheme would last for five years, with 50 trained furniture makers graduated every four months. Adejo said that the training would be conducted in collaboration with JBN Furniture Academy, Kaduna. He added that beside furniture making, the beneficiaries would also be trained on soap making, shoe making and painting to empower them with additional sources of income. He explained that the training was also designed to help the beneficiaries establish their businesses, adding that items produced during the training would be sold and the money offered to the trainees as seed capital. According to him, the goal of the training is to create direct employment for the Almajiris as well as orphans and other vulnerable groups. “Our desire is to improve the livelihood of the less privileged by providing them with economic empowerment and job opportunities. “We will equally develop managerial and leadership skills of the beneficiaries and create the needed awareness to encourage entrepreneurship because that is the only empowerment that focuses on direct employment through vocational training. “Our mission is to encourage Nigerians, especially the less privileged, to embrace entrepreneurship to address the problem of unemployment in the country. “Our dream is to see the less privileged become self-sufficient and financially independent through active involvement in commercial activities,” Adejo said (NAN)
