Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The governor of Imo state, Emeka Ihedioha, has denied ordering the arrest of the immediate past governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha. Ihedioha in a statement issued in Owerri on Saturday by his Chief Press Secretary, Chibuike Onyeukwu, described as malicious that he ordered the arrest of his predecessor. The governor said that he would continue to obey the rule of law. Ihedioha said that he would not interfere in the graft cases Okorocha was facing at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The statement read partly, “As a government, we are also conscious of the hate campaign against Governor Emeka Ihedioha, including, but not limited to the malicious allegation that he ordered the arrest of a citizen, the former Governor of the state, Chief Rochas Okorocha.” “Nothing can be farther from the truth. The Governor, who has a distinguished career and concluded his legislative assignment as a Presiding Officer of the House of Representatives, has also built an enduring reputation for respect for rule of law and the independence of the different arms of government. ” “In the alleged criminal matters involving the former governor which the relevant agencies are duly investigating, Governor Ihedioha believes that the law must be allowed to take its course as the judiciary is the arbiter in matters for which the former governor is being accused.” “We, therefore, wish to restate that Governor Ihedioha will not interfere in the investigation of the former governor by relevant agencies but shall continue to abide by and lead Imo State in the established democratic principles as enshrined in the laws of our land.”
