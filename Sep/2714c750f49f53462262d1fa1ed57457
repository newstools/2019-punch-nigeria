Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja More than 81 per cent of taxable adults and businesses in Nigeria do not pay their income taxes due to low tax moral in the country. The Research Director of the Fiscal Policy Roundtable of the Nigeria Economic Summit Group, Mr Tayo Oyedele, disclosed this in a presentation during a courtesy call on the Director General of the Nigeria Governorsâ€™ Forum, Mr Asishana Okauru. Oyedele was in the company with the Chairman of the Fiscal Policy Roundtable, Dr Sarah Alade, to solicit an opportunity to expose this sour point to the governors in order to seek their involvement to correct the ills that were denying the country of its collectible revenues.
