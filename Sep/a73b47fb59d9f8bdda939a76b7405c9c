Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja Nigeria’s inability to implement key initiatives in the agricultural sector is making the country’s contribution to global seed trade insignificant. According to the National Agricultural Seeds Council, Nigeria also benefits little from global seed trade due to limitations in the country’s agriculture initiatives. The Director-General, NASC, Olusegun Ojo, said this at a stakeholders meeting on the National Agricultural Seeds Council Act, 2019, organised by the National Economic Summit Group in conjunction with the seeds council in Abuja. Ojo said, “It is common knowledge that Nigeria and Africa as a whole currently contribute insignificantly to and benefit little from the international seed trade as we are yet to embrace a host of initiatives that will enable us play and participate in the global seed business. “One major tool that can change the dynamics is an enabling legislation and the right supportive regulations. The right legislation is a key driver of seed system strengthening which is critical in driving agricultural productivity in any country in the world.” He, however, noted that the signing into law of the National Agricultural Seeds Council Act 2019 on the 24th of June this year, would help address this challenge. Ojo noted that a nation’s agricultural sector would only advance when farmers of the country had access to available crop varieties that could give the best yield and resist or tolerate various stresses that confront agricultural plants on the field.
