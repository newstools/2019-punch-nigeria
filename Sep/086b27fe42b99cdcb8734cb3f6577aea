Maiharaji Altine, Gusau Another bandit leader in Zamfara State popularly known as Dogo Gide, has resorted to preaching, calling on his brothers who are yet to surrender to do so or face the wrath of God. Dogo Gide, who has repented a few months ago, now moves from one place to another with his associates, preaching to his colleagues on the consequences of banditry, calling on them to repent so as to attract God’s blessing in the world hereafter. A reliable source informed PUNCH that Dogo Gide had also resorted to fighting those Fulani who were unwilling to stop banditry where it was reported that, a few days ago, he engaged in a fight with four of such recalcitrant brothers, killing one of them in Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina State, very close to Zamfara State. The three others according to the source surrendered and handed over their guns to him, promising to stop banditry. It could be recalled that Dogo Gide was the second in command of the armed bandits during the reign of the most dreaded bandit leader, the late Buharin  Daji who was killed by Gide himself in May 2018 in a fracas between the duo during the tenure of former Governor Yari. There was disagreement between Gide and his late boss, Buhari Daji over the peace accord initiated by the former governor where Buharin Daji kicked against the peace process which resulted in his killing by Gide. Efforts by our correspondent to get the phone number of Dogo Gide in order to talk to him for more details were unsuccessful.
