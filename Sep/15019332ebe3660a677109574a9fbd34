Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Ahead of the Peoples Democratic Party’s primary election in Bayelsa State on Tuesday, September 3,a governorship aspirant, Mr. Keniebi Okoko has accused the state party chairman, Mr. Moses Cleopas, of bias. Okoko expressed dismay that Cleopas was already taking sides instead of being neutral in the political contest involving 21 aspirants. He was reacting to a statement credited to the PDP chairman in which he accused the aspirant of sending fake bank alerts to some unnamed delegates. He described Cleopas’ allegation in a statement he issued in Yenagoa on Monday as a brazen attempt to dent his hard-earned reputation in the eyes of his numerous supporters within and outside Bayelsa State. Okoko, who is the son of a former national president of  Ijaw National Congress and Professor of Political Science, Kimse Okoko, said he believed Cleopas did not act with the support of Governor Seriake Dickson “whose love for the PDP and the Bayelsa people has never been in doubt.” READ ALSO: $40m jewellery beyond Diezani’s income, EFCC insists He dismissed the allegation in its entirety, saying that he had never in his long years of being in private business engaged in fraudulent activities. Okoko pointed out that if there was anyone trying to hoodwink delegates then it was Cleopas who had in previous political exercises deployed such ill-advised acts to sway delegates’ votes to his preferred candidate, but it was now backfiring. The PDP aspirant said, “It is unfortunate that a man who ordinarily should be neutral in a contest as important as our party primaries has decided to take sides with some aspirants against other governorship hopeful in the party.” Okoko, who stated that he remained unshaken, added that the PDP chairman by his recent actions and utterances was bent on destroying the party, and called on the national leadership of the PDP to call him to order.
