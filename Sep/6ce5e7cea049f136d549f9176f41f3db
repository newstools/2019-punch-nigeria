Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Nigeria Immigration Service has intercepted two Nigeriens with pistols, computers and phones at the Kongolam border in Katsina State. The two men were said to have opened fire on the border security operatives, but one of them was gunned down, while his accomplice was arrested. The Public Relations Officer, NIS, Sunday James, who disclosed this in a statement in Abuja on Saturday, said the surviving suspect was assisting the operatives with useful information. He explained that the arrest was facilitated by the swift operation by the NIS border operatives. “This action by the operatives was after the visit by the NIS Comptroller-General, Muhammad Babandede, and his Customs counterpart, Col. Hammeed Ali (retd), to assess the level of cooperation, synergy and successes so far recorded,” the spokesman said. James stated that the surviving suspect had been handed over to the police. “After due interrogation and profiling, the surviving criminal has been handed over to the police for further necessary action,” he added.
