Abiodun Nejo The   Pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has urged the Federal Government to take decisive action over the xenophobic attacks against Nigerians in South Africa by sending strong signals to the Southern African nation. The National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin, who described the attacks as “unfortunate”, lamented that Federal Government’s action since the attacks began had not been impressive. Odumakin told our correspondent on the telephone on Wednesday that FG must take decisive action to protect the  Nigerians in South Africa. He said, “Nigerians have resorted to self-help and for the mob action to be stopped, the Federal Government should take appropriate domestic measures that will make South Africa know that Nigeria is pained. “But the Federal Government’s reaction has not been impressive. It is quite tardy. Even the kind of reactions we see during cattle rustling, we have not seen that in the killing of Nigerians in South Africa until this afternoon that the government said they were boycotting the World Economic Forum.

The government is not stopping the killing of Nigerians at home; it will be difficult to stop that in a foreign land. We expected there should be strict and decisive action that will bring South Africa begging and pleading with Nigeria.” Copyright PUNCH.
