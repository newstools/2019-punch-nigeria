Samuel Awoyinfa The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria and a former Nigerian envoy to the United States, Alhaji Hassan Adamu, say the only way to promote the nation’s economy and create jobs is when Nigerians patronise made-in-Nigeria products. They spoke on Monday during the opening of a three-day made-in-Nigeria products exhibition in Lagos. The MAN’s President, Mansur Ahmed, who said this was the first time the association would be holding a three-day exhibition, said it was being held to show to the world that Nigeria could produce what they would consume. He noted that the only way Nigerians could encourage local investments was to increase the capacity of local manufacturers by patronising their products and services, adding that this would lead to generation of wealth and creation of jobs. He said, “Very often, the people who produce the initial goods do not make as much money when compared to the people who carry out the final processing of these goods.” On his part, Adamu, the Wakili Adamawa, who was a guest of honour at the event, said no country experienced development without its citizens patronising services and products produced in the country.
