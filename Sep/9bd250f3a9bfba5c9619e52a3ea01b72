Peter Dada, Akure No fewer than 36 cows belonging to some Fulani herdsmen were struck dead by lightning on Saturday night in Ijare Community, Ifedore Local Government Area of Ondo State. A source said the herders took their cattle to Oke Owa bush, where, by tradition, only the king is permitted to enter it, because it is regarded as sacred. None of the herdsmen died, however, because they ran away when their cattle were struck dead, sources said. Confirming the incident, the Public Relations Officer of the Ondo State Police Command, Mr. Femi Joseph, said it was “natural disaster.” “It was a natural disaster and there is nothing anyone can do about it,” Joseph noted. Also reacting, the state chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Bello Garuba, confirmed the incident, describing it as “sad.” “It was an act of God; the owners must take heart,” Garuba counselled.
