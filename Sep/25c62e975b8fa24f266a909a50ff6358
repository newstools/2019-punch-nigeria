Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The disbursements to state governments from the Federal Account Allocation Committee has remained above N200bn on a monthly basis since January this year, the latest quarterly report put together by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative has revealed. Figures from the report showed that the monthly disbursements to states were above N200bn during the first six months of this year. “For the first six months of 2019, disbursements to states were N223.67bn in January, N230.66bn in February, N220.87bn in March, N218.08bn in April, N214.41bn in May and N228.04bn in June,” the report stated. However, when the figures for 2019 were compared with those for 2018, it was observed that nine states had their 2019 first half disbursements higher than the 2018 first half disbursements. This represented 25 per cent of the states. The states were Cross River, Delta, Ekiti and Imo. Others were Kano, Katsina, Plateau, Sokoto and Zamfara states. The degrees by which the 2019 disbursements exceeded the 2018 disbursements varied widely and ranged between N95.9m and N7.5bn, the report disclosed. It also revealed an interesting pattern of wide disparities in disbursements received by states as it noted that the disbursements by majority of the states (27 states) in the first half of 2019 were lower than disbursements in the first half of 2018. Thus, 75 per cent of the states received higher revenue in the first half of 2018 than the first half of 2019. The 36 states got N1.34tn in the first six months of the year, while the Federal Government received N1.6tn. For the 774 local government areas, a total of N792bn was received in the first half 2019, compared to N795bn and N549bn respectively in the first half of 2018 and in the first half of 2017. This implied that disbursements to the LGAs in the first half of 2019 were 0.4 per cent below the disbursements in the first half of 2018, and 44.11 per cent higher than the disbursements in the first half of 2017, according to the report. NEITI said its quarterly report was one of its policy and advocacy instruments intended to provide timely information and data that could be used to support citizens’ engagement, advocacy, information sharing and enlightenment in the tracking of the use of extractive revenue for development purposes. This, it said, was in line with the agency’s mandate of ensuring that there was transparency as well as accountability in the utilisation of extractive revenues by government. .Copyright PUNCH.
