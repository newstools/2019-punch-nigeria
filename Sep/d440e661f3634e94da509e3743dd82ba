The Lagos State Government has said that it will support non-governmental organisations that align themselves with its efforts and programmes aimed at grooming entrepreneurs in the state to contribute to the growth of the economy. An Assistant Director with the Lagos State Ministry of Wealth Creation and Employment, Thompson John, stated this at the end of the graduation organised by a non-governmental organisation, Motivated Women for Grassroots Support and Development Initiative, for 80 beneficiaries in Lagos. John noted that the collaboration became necessary when the ministry saw the passion and commitment of the organisation in alleviating poverty and unemployment in the society in line which with government’s plan. He said, “The ceremony was a nice one; it’s like giving back to the society and it’s part of what we are doing as a ministry and as a government. “We believe that the government cannot do it alone and so we are leveraging working with relevant stakeholders especially those ones that have passion for what they are doing. There are people that their focus is not just on what they want to gain but they are ready to make an impact on the people.’ “And that’s why the motivated women  have really been embraced by the ministry because we’ve seen what they have done.” The President of the NGO, Mrs Abiola Ajibade, explained that the organization was established in 2014 to support “the suffering women” in the society.
