Sampson Itode A woman whose identify has yet to be ascertained has been strangled to death in a hotel room in Rivers State. The incident happened about a month after a woman was also said to have been strangled to death in a hotel room along Woji Road in Port Harcourt.

An eyewitness who identified himself only as Peter told Sunday PUNCH that the victim’s hands and legs were both tied with a white cloth. Peter added that a white cloth presumed to have been used by her attacker was found around her neck. The Rivers State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Nnamdi Omoni, confirmed the incident, adding that the identity of the victim had yet to be ascertained. Omoni stated that the Commissioner of Police, Mustapha Dandaura, had directed that investigation be carried out into the incident. “The incident happened in Omoku but we have yet to ascertain the identity of the victim who is a young lady,” he said.
