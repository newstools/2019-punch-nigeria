Public project monitoring outfit, Tracka, has drawn the attention of Governor Gboyega Oyetola to the alleged bad state of 332 health care centres in Osun State. Tracka, a project by BudgIT, tracks and provides feedback on public projects throughout the country. Taking to its Twitter handle on Friday, the nongovernmental organisation had tweeted at Governor Oyetola: “Dear Gov
Gboyega Oyetola, this is a primary healthcare centre in Gidigbo community, Mosinola Iwo LGA. “It is one of the 332 healthcare centres to be rehabilitated in Osun State. “We tracked the health facility and observed that work is yet to commence.” The tweet also featured a series of photographs, such as the Primary Health Centre, Obatedo, Iwo Local Government Area of Osun State. According to the facility’s signboard, the health centre was built with the support of the European Union, but it is currently in serious state of dilapidation. Tracka also drew the governor’s attention to a primary healthcare centre in Molete 2, Yidi Oba community, Iwo LGA. See some of the photographs, courtesy, Tracka via Twitter:
