Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta The Governorship candidate of the Allied People’s Movement, Adekunle Akinlade, has broken his silence over his loss at the state Governorship election petitions tribunal. Akinlade said he had applied for a Certified True Copy of the tribunal judgement on Monday with a view to knowing the next steps to be taken. The APM Governorship candidate, stated this on Monday, during a press conference held at the party Secretariat along Abiola Way, Abeokuta. A three-man election petitions tribunal on Saturday had dismissed his petition filed against the victory of the state Governor, Dapo Abiodun, at the March 9, 2019 election in the state. He explained that the application for a copy of the judgement was to enable his lawyers to study the content of the judgement and advise him appropriately. He, however, hinted on his rejection of the judgement of the three-man tribunal, claiming that the decision of the tribunal did not reflect what was presented before it during the trial. He said, “The verdict gave us a setback, truth must be told. They said we did not vote .  What happened on Saturday was a display of an authority which possesses both the truth and falsehood. “We have applied for a copy of the judgement and once we get the copy, our lawyers will study it thoroughly and advise appropriately. “It is not what we took to the tribunal that was decided on.” Speaking further on the judgment, Akinlade said, “You might buy the judgement but you cannot buy God’s judgement. “I  am proud to have run as governor and I have said many times that, the will of the people must not be subdued. “We are going to explore all the constitutional rights we have in our constitution to protect our mandate “.
