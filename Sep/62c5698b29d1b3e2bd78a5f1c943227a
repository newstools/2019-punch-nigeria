Afeez Hanafi with agency report Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria, Taraba chapter, Pastor Isaiah Jirapye, has said that food crisis is imminent if the Tiv/Jukun communal violence was not checked. Jirapye told the News Agency of Nigeria on Saturday in Jalingo that the tribes locked in the conflict were predominantly farmers, lamenting that the violence had made it difficult for them to visit the fields. The clergy, who particularly condemned the gruesome murder of Rev. Fr. David Tanko by gunmen on Takum-Wukari Road, advised the perpetrators to repent and seek the face of the Lord. He said, “It is worrisome that both Tiv and Jukun, who have been living together as brothers, will fight so dirty, killing and destroying their homes. “Another issue of concern is that both ethnic groups are predominantly farmers who have been forced to desert their farms due to fear of attacks. “The adverse effects are that this crisis will lead to food shortage and that will affect every body. I am appealing to both parties to sheath their swords and embrace peace.” Copyright PUNCH.
