Ada Wodu, Calabar A Corporal in the Nigerian Army, Femi Awotayo, has been arrested and is being detained at a police facility in Calabar for allegedly killing a police Inspector, Christopher Achong, at a checkpoint in Cross River State. Awotayo, who serves with the 707 Special Force Brigade in Benue State, was arrested with four others after the incident. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, confirmed the arrest to our correspondent on Monday. “We arrested the soldier and four others. They are at the state Criminal Investigation Department for interrogation after which they will be prosecuted,” she said. It was gathered that the incident happened at Anyikang in the Bekwarra Local Government Area of Cross River State, when Achong, who was leading a patrol team, stopped a commuter bus on the Ogoja-Katsina Ala Expressway. The bus was said to be conveying passengers to Calabar, about 300 kilometres away. Sources in Bekwarra said an argument ensued between the soldier and the inspector, which degenerated into a clash after which the inspector was rushed to the General Hospital in Bekwarra for treatment, where he later died.
