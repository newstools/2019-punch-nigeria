Infinix Mobility, Africa’s premium smartphone brand, hosted afro-pop superstar Davido on Wednesday at the company’s Lagos office. A statement on the visit said the mobile phone is considering partnering with  Davido in order to empower more Nigerians. Infinix mobility said it unveiled Davido as its brand ambassador last year May 8, 2018. The company described the artist as a highly Influential personality in the musical industry, saying a  cohesive partnership would inspire and empower young adults within their scope of influence, both locally and globally. The statement said a typical example of an initiative from both entities geared towards empowering youths and supporting creativity among young adults was the recently concluded #Infinixblowmymind challenge that saw winners go home with a total cash prize of N500,000 and other amazing branded gifts.
