Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Elections Petitions Tribunal handling the Imo State governorship election cases has reserved a yet-to-be-announced date for judgment. This came after the parties in the petitions had adopted their final addresses. The petitioners were Uche Nwosu of the Action Alliance; Senator Ifeanyi Araraume of the All Progressives Grand Alliance; and Senator Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress. The APC governorship candidate who came fourth at the polls asked the Tribunal to declare him the winner of the election, while the APGA candidate asked the panel to cancel the poll. Nwosu asked the panel to either declare him the rightful winner of the election or cancel it and order a supplementary election between him and Governor Emeka Ihedioha. At the adoption of the their final addresses on Sunday, the petitioners said there were glaring evidences that Ihedioha did not win the March 9 governorship election. Counsels to the governor, Onyechi Ikpeazu, SAN, the Independent National Electoral Electoral Commission, Eke Ejelam, SAN, and the Peoples Democratic Party, Ken Njemanze, SAN, asked the panel to dismiss the petitions and uphold Ihedioha’s electoral victory. The counsel to the APC governorship candidate, Olusola Oke, SAN, said the code of the Tribunal made it illegal for it to sit on a Sunday. He asked the Tribunal to adopt Sunday as a sitting day, so as to legalise the day’s proceedings. The Tribunal immediately adopted Sunday as a sitting day. Oke therefore urged the Tribunal to declare his client the winner of the election. The Chairman of the Tribunal, Michael Adewara, who heard the final addresses with other members of the panel, said the date of the judgments would be communicated to the parties.
