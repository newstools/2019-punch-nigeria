Ademola Babalola, Ibadan The Federal Government has approved special promotion for outstanding police officers,  according to the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, in Ibadan on Tuesday. Adamu, who paid a working visit to Oyo State, said the move  was aimed at   rewarding excellence as well as  boosting  the morale of the officers. The IG  also  said  President Muhammadu Buhari had  agreed to build new barracks and standardise the existing ones. He  told the officers that he had met with South-West  governors, traditional rulers and other stakeholders on Monday. He said,  “We discussed the security situation in the South-West and we came out with resolutions. “It is with the support of the officers  of the command with the assistance of our special forces that the resolutions from that summit can be implemented. “We are all appreciative of the fact that you have worked hard to keep this region safe for business to thrive. We know there are some isolated challenges here and there, but without your presence, without your input, without your dedication to fighting crime, the situation would have been worse.” He added,  “The President has instructed me that any police officer, especially within the junior cadre, anyone that excels must be promoted.” Copyright PUNCH.
