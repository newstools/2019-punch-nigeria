James Abraham, Jos Gunmen have again attacked Vatt village in Foron district of Plateau State and killing two people. The fresh attack is the second time in a week the village was attacked by gunmen that left two people equally dead. The victims were later identified as  Mr Musa Gwom and Mr John Bulus. Our Correspondent could not immediately ascertain the identity of the latest victims as of press time but the Lawmaker representing Barkin Ladi Constituency in the State House of Assembly, Mr Peter Gyendeng, confirmed the fresh killing to our Correspondent in Jos on Saturday. The lawmaker who said that he had visited the place told our correspondent  that his people were not happy over the recurrent violent attacks in the community. He called on the security agents to do everything possible to stop further attacks in his constituency and other parts of the state. Gyendeng said, “About three days ago, two people were killed by gunmen when they attacked the village. Just yesterday ( Friday),  they attacked the village again and killed two people. “I have visited the place to see things for myself together with the security men. “Their new method is to allege without proof that their cows have been stolen and then, the next thing is to attack the people of their target. “We can not continue like this.” The State Police Command is yet to make a public statement over the  renewed killings.
