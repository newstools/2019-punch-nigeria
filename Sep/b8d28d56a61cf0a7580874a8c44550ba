US president, Donald Trump on Sunday called the model Chrissy Teigen “filthy-mouthed” and her husband, musician, John Legend “boring” in tweets on Sunday night, while lauding his achievements in criminal justice reform, prompting them to fire back. Mr. Legend called on the First Lady, Melania to intervene, tweeting, “Imagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody–ANYBODY–will praise you. Melania, please praise this man. He needs you. Your country needs you, Melania.” His wife laced her tweets with vulgarities. The couple, who are married, are both frequent critics of the president. By Monday morning, the expletives used by Ms. Teigen — including one that Mr. Trump famously used in a recording that surfaced shortly before his election in 2016 — were part of a trending hashtag on Twitter. A related hashtag, #filthymouthedwife, was also trending, reports The New York Times.

The president began by pointing to the criminal justice reform legislation he passed last year. “Now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is — but I didn’t see them around when we needed help getting it passed.” He did not name Ms. Teigen, which she noted in her response. “Tagged everyone but me,” she wrote. “An honor, mister president.” She added that she had not been mentioned in the MSNBC special that Mr. Trump appeared to have watched.
