Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Polytechnics has decried the lack of adequate infrastructure in federal and state polytechnics nationwide, saying the Federal Government has failed to implement the 2013 needs’ assessment report carried out on the institutions. The SSANIP National President, Sunday Sabo, stated this in Abuja on Tuesday at the fifth National Delegates Conference of the union. He said, “The challenges of polytechnic education are enormous; most of our challenges are about infrastructure. Some of the equipment is outdated. We need modern equipment for teaching and learning to take place. The buildings are old and outdated. There are a lot of things in the system that are not okay. “Because of our cry to the government, a presidential committee was set up in 2013 by the government to assess the needs of the polytechnics and I was a party to it. So, we went round all the polytechnics in the country. We went round all the polytechnics – federal, state and even some private polytechnics to assess the needs. “The document has been submitted to the government since then but up till today, nothing has been done on that. It is our belief that when the issues contained in that document are addressed, our polytechnics will be said to have got to the level they are supposed to.” The union complained that some state governments had yet to comply with the directive on 65 years of retirement age.
