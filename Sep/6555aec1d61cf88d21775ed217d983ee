Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari on the validation of his re-election by the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal. Wike’s congratulatory message was conveyed in a statement by his Special Assistant on Electronic Media, Mr. Simeon Nwakaudu. The News Agency of Nigeria recalls that the PDP and its candidate, Atiku Abubakar, had approached the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal in Abuja, seeking the nullification of the victory of Buhari in the February 23, 2019 poll. But delivering judgment on the matter on Wednesday, Justice Mohammed Garuba dismissed all the grounds of the petition. The governor urged Buhari to use his victory to work for all Nigerians, irrespective of their political leanings. Wike also called on the president to work toward the unity of the country. (NAN)
