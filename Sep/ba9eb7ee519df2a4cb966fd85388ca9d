Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency on Tuesday declared that it would sack incompetent environmental consultants who degrade the country’s environmental laws. According to the Director General of NESREA, Prof. Aliyu Jauro, the agency has established that some consultants are enmeshed in professional misconduct. Jauro disclosed this in Abuja at the 4th induction course for 2019 accredited environmental consultants organised by the agency. He explained that the consultants being inducted were responsible for carrying out environmental auditing on behalf of their clients while NESREA’s role would be to review their work and issue certificates accordingly. He stated that NESREA had 33 environmental regulations that dealt with waste management. The NESREA boss said that the agency would fully implement the regulations in a bid to resolving problems associated with poor waste management. Jauro said, “We have different types of waste such as e-waste, medical waste, solid and liquid waste but our regulations in the area of medical waste will soon be ready.” He told participants at the event that NESREA was collaborating with similar agencies on sound environmental management since its regulation covered issues on desertification and flooding. He assured his audience that the agency would address issues of desertification caused by incessant felling of trees and vowed to sanction developers in the housing and construction sector building houses on waterways.
