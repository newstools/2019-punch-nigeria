Tony Okafor,Awka The National Emergency Management Agency has asked people living in flood -proned  areas  to flee to avert disaster. The acting Director General of the Agency, Air Commodore Akugbe Iyamu, stated this on Sunday in the  Ogbaru Local Government Area  of Anambra State during an assessment tour of flooded areas in the state. He said, “How will someone say it’s my ancestral home and wants to die there? This is not a time to defend whether the area is your ancestral home or not. “To be able to change the narrative, you need to come out first and get saved before defending whether it’s your ancestral home or not.” He noted that Nigeria was not the only country grappling with erosion problems. He  expressed appreciation to the  army and the navy for making available necessary equipment for the evacuation of victims. Copyright PUNCH.
