Women have expressed outrage about a “wonder bra” that has been touted as capable of preventing wrinkles around the breast area. The pillow bra, which looks like a fancy version of a roller coaster seat restraint, is meant to be worn while sleeping. The pink product is made from lace, and wraps around the shoulders to sit in the middle of the chest. According to the brand’s website, the bra is “a must have for ladies with gorgeous forms.” As women take to the social media to express their unflattering opinion about the costly gadget, the manufacturers, Sleep & Glow, released a statement on the matter. “We hadn’t expected that our ad would generate such a discussion. “Our pillow bra product is for those ladies who are concerned about cleavage wrinkles. “In no way were we raising such a concern among women who don’t have it. “It’s a free choice of every lady to be or not to be concerned about this problem. “Many women use cloths and towels to separate breasts during sleep to fight cleavage wrinkles and sweating. “We have developed the pillow bra, which is much better than those ‘do it yourself’ solutions. “Our mission was and is to improve lives of women who are concerned about the problem of cleavage wrinkles. “Beauty care is a personal choice of every woman and we respect any choice she makes.” This has not stopped women from talking. “Just thinking through the logistics of this… I don’t think there’s room for the boob thing between the boobs without creating a whole other side wrinkle issue…” —Becca Bell @Beccabell05 “I don’t understand anything anymore….” —Dawn French  @Dawn_French “Don’t have that problem, mine hide in my armpits at night.”  —Helen@hjmac41
