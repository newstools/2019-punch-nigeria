Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has said the upper legislative chamber is still expecting the executive arm of government to forward the Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper to it for consideration. Lawan’s declaration contradicted his position on Friday when he told journalists information at his disposal indicated that the documents had been sent to the federal parliament. Rising from a closed session with fellow senators on Tuesday, Lawan said the documents had not been sent. He said the Senate during the closed session resolved to await the transmission of the 2020-2022 MTEF/FSP and the 2020 budget proposals from the presidency for expeditious consideration and possible approval. “The Senate at the closed door session deliberated on issues bordering on the workings of the Senate in particular and National Assembly in general. “The Senate also resolved to await the transmission of the MTEF and 2020 budget proposals from the presidency for expeditious consideration and required approval,” he said. He also said that the 69 standing committees of the 9th Senate would be inaugurated on Wednesday, 25th September. Lawan, who made the announcement after about an hour executive session, said the committee’s inauguration would be done at once in plenary. The Senate President had on the 30th of July, 2019, before the Senate embarked on long recess, announced the composition of the committees by naming their chairmen and vice chairmen. Copyright PUNCH.
