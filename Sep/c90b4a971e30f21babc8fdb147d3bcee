Ada Wodu, Calabar The police in Calabar, the Cross River State capital, have rescued a man from being lynched by a mob for allegedly snatching a woman’s bag. The incident happened at the Mayne Avenue by Murray Street in Calabar South, where the mob had put two used car tyres round the neck of the young man and was about to set him ablaze when the police intervened and rescued him. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, confirmed to our correspondent that the police rescued the victim from the angry mob. Ugbo stated, “He was rescued. He is currently receiving treatment. We have not taken a statement from him because he is still receiving treatment. After treatment, we will take his statement and charge him. According to the story, he snatched a bag from a woman. “We have always told people not to take the law into their hands. Anybody who kills another is a murderer. Whatever offence that person was caught for, the murderer also is an accomplice. We always advise that whenever people arrest criminals, such should be handed over to the police.” Copyright PUNCH.
