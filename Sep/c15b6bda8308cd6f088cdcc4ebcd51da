Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Kafayat, wife of Osun State Governor Adegboyega  Oyetola,  on Tuesday launched a  campaign against open defecation in the state. Oyetola, who spoke during the launch of a conference to eliminate open defecation in the state at GT Hotel, Ikire, urged residents to always use toilets, rather than engaging in open defecation. She said the age-long practice of open defecation posed grave consequences to healthy living. She said, “Open defecation carries grave health consequences for all of us. It is a destroyer of our health and pollutant of our environment. “Every time we step out to openly defecate, we are deliberately inviting water borne diseases such as diarrhoea , cholera and typhoid to ravage. It has been found out that open defecation is one of the factors leading to mortality among children under five years of age.” Oyetola told  mothers to be at the forefront of the campaign to stop open defecation   in the state.
