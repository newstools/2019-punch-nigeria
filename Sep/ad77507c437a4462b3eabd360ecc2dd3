This time, that won’t be happening again. “I have instructed that the Minister of State for Transportation should personally supervise the maritime agencies, while I just oversee what is happening.” Amaechi said he had discussed issues on maritime safety with President Muhammadu Buhari and assured his listeners that by next year, the country will have a single window in the maritime sector. He said, “There are two things I discussed with Mr. President that I will be focusing on in this second term as minister, and they are maritime security and the single window project. “I have assured the government that by the end of 2020, we should have the single window at our maritime sector. “On maritime security, I have told the Israeli firm HSLI that they are too slow. By now, they should have launched. I want to know the situation of things with the aspect of security on our maritime space.”
