The Plateau National and State Houses of Assembly Election Petition Tribunal has dismissed a petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party, challenging the victory of Senator Hezekiah Dimka of the All Progressives Congress in the February 23 election. Senator Dimka is presenting Plateau Central in the Senate. Delivering judgment, Justice J.I. Nwoye, chairman of the tribunal, dismissed the petition filed by a former Immigration boss, Mr David Paradang of the PDP. Paradang had prayed the tribunal to declare him the winner of the election following alleged election malpractices that characterised the election.

He held that the petition was incompetent. The tribunal, therefore, expunged all evidence presented by the PDP from its record. “This honourable tribunal has to expunge all the petitioner’s evidence because they failed to prove all. “Consequently, this petition is, therefore, struck out and dismissed for lacking in merit,” Nwoye held.
