Femi Makinde The Afenifere Renewal Group has warned the All Progressives Congress, especially those from the northern part of the country, against making statements to undermine the zoning of the presidency in 2023. The group said statements credited to some northerners suggesting that zoning arrangement might be dropped in 2023 were capable of plunging the nation into an unimaginable crisis. The National Publicity Secretary of ARG, Kunle Famoriyo, in a statement on Monday, stressed that rotation of the presidency between the North and the South was the only thing giving some persons a sense of belonging, saying it should not be jettisoned now for any reason. The statement read, “The ARG cautions all politicians, leaders and followers alike to desist from actions and comments capable of setting the country ablaze or further undermining the peace and stability in the country. “Unguarded comments by some northern politicians and leaders, especially from the ruling All Progressives Congress, suggest they are doing everything to shoot down the generally-accepted zoning formula between southern and northern Nigeria, in electing the country’s president. This is a clear case of invitation to anarchy and instability. “It is unthinkable to change the goalpost in the middle of a match or change the rules when the game is on. But the comments of these leaders are seen as attempts to deny the South the legitimate right to produce the country’s next president in 2023.” Copyright PUNCH.
