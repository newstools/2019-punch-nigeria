Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The abducted mother of former coach Samson Siasia has yet to regain her freedom 55 days after she was kidnapped. It was gathered on Sunday that 80-year-old Mrs Beauty Ogere Siasia was still in the kidnappers’ den and clues about her whereabouts had remained vague. She was whisked away on July 15 by heavily armed gunmen who invaded her Odoni country home in Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. The bandits were said to have escaped with the octogenarian through the River Nun in a speedboat. It was the second time in four years Madam Siasia would be taken away from her sleepy community by a gang of armed men. She was abducted in November 2015 by a gang of gunmen who released her after spending 12 days in their custody. Three days after the latest incident on July 15, the gunmen reportedly contacted the Siasia family and demanded the sum of N70m as ransom to set her free. But on July 30, they reduced the ransom from N70m to N50m despite pleas by Siasia that he was jobless and that they should release his mother unconditionally. A family source, who confided in our reporter on Sunday, said there was no information on Madam Siasia’s destination.
