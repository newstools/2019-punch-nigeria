Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki Leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kalu, claims that “a combined security forces” besieged his country home in Isiama Afara-Ukwu Ibeku, Umuahia, Abia State. He said the incident happened on Saturday. The Police said the claim was absolutely untrue. On his Twitter handle @MaziNnamdiKanu, the IPOB leader had tweeted:  Also, IPOB’s Media and Publicity Director, Emma Powerful, alleged to our Correspondent that “combined security agents” had their six Hilux vans stationed in front of Kanu’s compound at about 10pm on Saturday, and were seen “loitering” around the area leading to Okpara Avenue towards Factory Road, in Umuahia, the state capital. He alleged, “Another round of genocide looms again in front of our leader’s compound in Isiama Afara Ukwu Ibeku Umuahia, Abia State, by Fulani terror group. The PUNCH reports that the development came barely five hours, after Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State had announced the creation of Ministry of Homeland Security to tackle herdsmen and other crimes in the state, on Saturday. Meanwhile, the Abia State Police Command has denied alleged besiege of Kanu’s home by any security agents on Saturday night. The Command’s spokesperson, Geoffrey Ogbonna, said Kanu’s home was never besieged by security agents, as doing so was not only a waste of time, but a waste energy by the security agencies. “Why would security agents besiege Kanu’s home? Kanu, I’m sure, is not around and his Afara Ukwu home, I’m sure for now, is safe. “So, who besieged his house? What time did you hear this? This is very late and I can’t confirm this now. “But, it has not gotten to my knowledge. “You know, these days, people spread rumours anyhow,” Ogbonna said.
