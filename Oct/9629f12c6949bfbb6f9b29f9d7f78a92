Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Speaker, Ogun State House of Assembly, Mr. Olakunle Oluomo, has called on the State Ministry of Works and Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Agency to immediately install barriers on both sides of the Ososa Bridge on the Sagamu-Benin Expressway. He also urged the appropriate authorities to install reflective traffic signals to alert road users of the danger spot, with a view to averting any further loss of lives on the failing portion of the bridge. It may be recalled that, in recent times, many road users had perished when their vehicles plunged into the Ososa River. Indeed, no fewer than 10 passengers were feared dead on Wednesday, October 2, 2019, when a commercial Toyota Sienna vehicle plunged into Ososa River on the Sagamu-Ijebu-Ode-Benin  Expressway in the Odogbolu Local Government Area of Ogun State. Oluomo, who noted that the road belonged to the Federal Government, gave the directive while responding to the submissions of members, State House of Assembly on Thursday at the Plenary. The members include Kemi Oduwole, Lamidi Musefiu, Abayomi Fasuwa, Bolanle Ajayi, Sylvester Abiodun, Adegoke Adeyanju, Bello Atinuke, Ganiyu Oyedeji and Oludaisi Elemide who had called for government’s intervention on the situation of roads in their respective constituencies. The Speaker attributed the deplorable state of the roads to long years of neglect by past administrations. He also appealed to residents of the state to bear with government, saying, full road construction and rehabilitation, where necessary, would commence immediately the rains subside.
