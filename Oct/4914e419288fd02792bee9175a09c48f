Friday Olokor, Abuja The Federal Government has pledged its full support for the successful hosting of the 2019 All Africa Music Awards, as the country prepares to host the glamorous event in Lagos on 20-23 November 2019, with the theme: ”Feel Africa.” The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made the pledge in a statement in Lagos on Sunday. He said, ”When you look at the All Africa Music Awards, it’s one of the biggest awards in the music industry in Africa, and what government has done in the past is to provide the enabling environment for the awards to take place. ”We provided support services for AFRIMA, we gave them the backing they need and I think it’s on record that the AFRIMA editions that have been held in Nigeria have been among the most successful.

music awards is because the country has relaxed its visa regime, with the visa-on-arrival policy, thus making it easier for people to come in. AFRIMA, which was first held in 2014, was established in collaboration with the African Union to reward and celebrate musical talents
and creativity in Africa as well as to promote African Cultural Heritage.
