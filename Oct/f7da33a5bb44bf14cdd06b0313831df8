Olalekan Adetayo A former Chairman of the Special Presidential Panel for the Recovery of Public Property, Okoi Obono-Obla, on Saturday claimed that some people were bent on demonising him. Obono-Obla, who was recently declared wanted by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, said this in a message he posted on his Facebook page. Describing himself as a true patriot, he said he did his job with utmost dedication. He lamented that those who stole from the treasury were not treated the way he was being treated. He said, “What (sic) are these people after me? They took their job away, yet they are not done. “They smeared me in the media, they framed me. They lied against me. They declared me wanted.  What offence have I committed? Even those who have stolen billions (of naira) or contributed to the wrecking of the national economy are not treated with such indignity. “They just want to humiliate me. They want to break me. They want to demonise me before Nigerians. “I am (a) true patriot of Nigeria. I did my job with utmost dedication, dignity, integrity and commitment.” The ICPC declared the former presidential aide wanted due to his repeated failure to appear before the commission to answer questions bordering on allegations of corruption. “Mr Obono-Obla is facing a series of allegations levelled against him by members of the public on his role as head of the government panel on asset recovery. “The commission is in receipt of petitions accusing him of abuse of office, falsification of admission records, living above his income and collection of gratification from suspects under his investigation,” the ICPC had said.
