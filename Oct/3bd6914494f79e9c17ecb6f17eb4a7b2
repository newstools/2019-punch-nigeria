Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Some armed soldiers on Monday descended on the headquarters of the Osun State police command in Osogbo, breaking the gate to the premises. According to some traders with shops near the police headquarters, three of the soldiers had already entered into the command’s premises before others were stopped at the gate. A trader, identified as Nkechi, who claimed many of them (traders) with businesses in the area had to hurriedly close for the day for fear of being caught in the crossfire, told our correspondent that about 25 armed soldiers were seen at the gate of the command engaging policemen manning it in hot argument around 1:00 p.m. “Later a senior police officer with the name Edward Ebuka, intervened and the soldiers left the area,” she said.

He said the mission of the soldiers in the area might not be unconnected with the arrest and detention of a soldier in Osogbo over an offence that could not be immediately ascertained last Saturday. He said, “Those that came had planned to disarm our men at the gate and enter into the area. A soldier is being held since Saturday for an offence I don’t know at the State Criminal Investigation Bureau. “I think those soldiers that came wanted to forcefully free him. Presently, four soldiers are being held here (at command). When called for reaction, Police Public Relation Officer of Osun Police Command, Folasade Odoro, neither confirmed nor denied the incident. She said, “Newsmen would be briefed later on what happened here today very soon.”
