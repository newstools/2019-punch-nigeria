The Senateâ€™s ad hoc committee investigating a case of assault against Senator Elisha Abbo on Tuesday submitted its report to the upper chamber. Astatement by the red chamber said the report was presented during plenary by the Chairman of the ad hoc committee, Senator Sam Egwu. The Senate had on July 3, 2019, set up the committee to investigate Abbo for allegedly assaulting a lady at a sex toy shop in Abuja. The lawmaker was seen in a video which went viral having an altercation with the lady in question. Abbo allegedly assaulted the woman for taking side with the shop owner who the lawmaker had accused of insulting him. The incident reportedly happened on May 11, 2019 exactly one month before the 41-year-old lawmaker was sworn into the 9th Senate.
