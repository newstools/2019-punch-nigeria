Oladimeji Ramon A non-governmental organisation, Laws and Rights Awareness Initiative, has urged the National Industrial Court to declare that the Federal Government is subjecting Nigerian workers to forced labour with its failure to pay the N30,000 minimum wage since April. Counsel for the Incorporated Trustees of LRAI, Olumide Babalola, contended in the suit filed at the NIC, Abuja division, that the Federal Government’s non-payment of the N30,000 minimum wage was a breach of Section 9(2)(c) of the National Minimum Wage (Amendment) Act 2019. “The respondent’s payment of salaries less than the minimum wage constitutes forced labour in violation of the provision of Section 34(1)(c) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended),” the lawyer said.
