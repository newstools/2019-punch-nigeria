Simon Utebor An illustrious son of Ogun State, who is also the President of Gbenga Akinwande Foundation, Gbenga Akinwande, has appealed to Governor Dapo Abiodun to jettison the idea of establishing two universities in the state due to the current structural financial challenges of the state. In a letter to Abiodun, the GAF boss wrote, “What I think your Excellency should focus on is on the efficiency and enhancement of the standard of the existing institutions we have in the state currently. “Although, there is an urgent need to establish a university in Ogun West, I would politely suggest that the facilities put in place by the former Governor Ibikunle Amosun at Ipokia for Ogun State Polytechnic should be used for the proposed Moshood Abiola University of Science and Technology. “The reason for this suggestion is in fairness to Ogun West senatorial district, considering the contribution of that zone to the economic development of Ogun and Nigeria at large. Thus, it is necessary for the state government to demonstrate to the people of Ogun West that they are integral parts of the state. “Although I am aware that the people of Ogun Central might be infuriated by taking MAUSTECH to Ogun West, what I think Governor Abiodun can do at the moment is to constitute an Ogun State conference of ethnic-nationalities whereby all the three senatorial districts will send about 20 delegates each to a five-day roundtable conference for serious discussions on our coexistence as a people in the state.” Akinwande said the conference would help in addressing the social, economic and political imbroglio that had characterised Ogun over 43 years of existence.
