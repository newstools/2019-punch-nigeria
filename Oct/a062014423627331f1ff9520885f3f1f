DANIELS IGONI Five more aides to Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State have resigned their positions in his administration few weeks to the forthcoming governorship election. They include B. N Erewari-Igbeta, Special Adviser on Environment; Benjamin Ogbara, Director, Ethics and Compliance, Due Process Bureau; Lawrence Ebede, Special Adviser; Natus Zebakame, Special Adviser on ICT Development and Iniruo Ipogi, Special Assistant on Students’ Affairs. Also, the Chairman, Bayelsa State Sanitation Authority, Robert Enogha, has withdrawn his membership of the Peoples Democratic Party while the party’s legal adviser in Ekeremor Local Government Area, Omoro Ogei, has quit his position. They made their resignations and PDP membership withdrawal known in separate letters addressed to the governor and the state chairman of the party. Erewari-Igbeta, Ogei, Ipogi and Zebakame said in their letters, copies of which were sighted by our correspondent, that they resigned on “personal grounds” while Ogbara said he was quitting “to go back into private legal practice.” However, Ebede said his reason for resigning was “mostly ideological”, stressing that he could no longer continue “aiding and supporting the emperorship of the restoration party.” Enogha, in his resignation letter dated October 18, 2019, said he was withdrawing his membership of the PDP “with so much pain as a foundation member of the PDP which was truly democratic then.” He added that he had lost confidence in the party’s ability to uphold the tenets of democracy hence the withdrawal of his membership. However, none of the appointees indicated that they were defecting from the PDP to the opposition All Progressives Congress. Copyright PUNCH.
