According to him, the farmers believe that the two diseases, coined Zazzalau and Raba, have no remedy for now. The chairman, however, said the association had not reported the outbreak to relevant government agencies for intervention but would do so immediately. The Acting Permanent Secretary, state Ministry of Agriculture, Muhammad Lawal, said the ministry was not aware of the outbreak. “We have no information on the outbreak of any strange disease. We don’t have any information in our records on the disease. “I urge farmers to write to their Local Government councils of any outbreak of a strange disease for onward transmission to us and we assure that we are going to take necessary action,” Lawal said.
