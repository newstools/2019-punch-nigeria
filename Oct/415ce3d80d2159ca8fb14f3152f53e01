Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo. A defendant, Ibrahim Saheed, has been remanded in the Ilesha Correctional Facility, Osun State, for unruly behaviour during a court session. Saheed was arraigned before Magistrate Opeyemi Badmus of an Osun State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Osogbo over allegations bordering on attempted robbery. But when the charges were about to be read, Saheed, who had all the while been calm, suddenly started shouting. He said, “I am not the one; they are just lying against me. I am not the one that attempted to rob him. We have been living in the same house in Abere for a long time.” He also asked the magistrate to allow him go out of the court to urinate when the clerk started reading his charges. Even before the magistrate could respond to the request, Saheed had urinated on himself. The magistrate asked the complainant, Abdulsalam Raji, if he knew the accused. Raji, however, denied ever living in the same house with him.

The police prosecutor, Elisha Olusegun, said the accused was only  feigning insanity, adding that they both conversed well before the court sat. Copyright PUNCH.
