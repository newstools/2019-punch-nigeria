Sunday Aborisade, Abuja the Director/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigeria Financial Intelligence Unit, Moddibo Tukur, has clarified that his agency did not ask for a reduction in the annual budget of the Central Bank of Nigeria. He was reported to have demanded the reduction in the annual budget of the CBN to enable the government to accommodate salaries and operational needs of his agency. But Tukur, in a chat with our correspondent on Wednesday, explained that his appeal was for salaries of operatives of the NFIU to be captured as sub-head under the yearly expenditure profile of the apex bank. He said, “We are not seeking a reduction in the annual budget of the Central Bank of Nigeria. We are only demanding that we should be part of their responsibilities. “As an autonomous agency, we cannot make such demands. We are only saying that CBN is shouldering a lot of responsibilities and that we should be part of it. “We believe it would be easier for us that way than always taking money from government.” Tukur had defended his agency’s 2020 budget before the Senate Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes on Tuesday. He had told the Senate panel that since NFIU was now domiciled in CBN as an autonomous agency, its salary structure and condition of service should reflect that of the CBN 100 per cent.
