Following the tanker fire incident that resulted in the death of some people and the destruction of properties at Ochanja market, Upper Iweka in Onitsha on Wednesday, Anambra State Governor Willie Obiano has come under severe criticisms. A woman and her baby had died, alongside others in the incident, even as it was reported that men of the fire service couldn’t put out the fire when they arrived at the scene due to a faulty valve. Many Nigerians have since taken to Twitter to react to the incident, with Governor Obiano at the centre of the tweetstorm. See some of the reactions: “Hmmm! We shout it often! This idea of abandoning our States to concentrate on Aso Rock politics will do no one good! Know your Gov’s handle, follow it, ask questions, posit ideas etc. A whole State, no functional Fire Service vehicle… Buhari’s fault?” —Olufunke Lawanson @bravefacefunkie. “Ị lost someone in the inferno yesterday. No fire service to help for over 3 straight hours. Life and properties were destroyed The governor must answer for this.” —@AdaezeChalene. “How can a government be so utterly clueless and useless in the face of a very controllable situation? Well, zero planning and foresight. Plus lack of consequences for public actions and inactions.” —Alberttt, @VeryAlbert. “Mediocrity has been accepted in Anambra state and I can’t believe we allowed it. We have fallen far from our standard. We are ndị Anambra. We are not lazy, we are champions and our leader must be one too. We can’t take anything less! Obiano must sit up.” —@Geraldcake. “Dear traders across Nigeria, we have irresponsible govt at all levels. Kindly organise yourselves and buy fire fighting trucks and equipment, mount it close to your market and train people on how to use them. Wait for no government, they will fail you again and again!” —Okey @Okeydgeneral The Anambra State House of Assembly on Thursday constituted a committee to investigate the fire incident.
