Sokoto State Government said on Saturday that no fewer than 210 bandits have repented since its commencement of the peace dialogue with bandits in the state. The State Commissioner for Carrier and Security Matters, retired Col. Garba Moyi, disclosed this to newsmen in Sokoto. Moyi, who is coordinating the peace dialogue, also said it has facilitated the release of all persons kidnapped by the bandits. According to him, those freed, mostly Sokoto indigenes and some from Kebbi, Zamfara and Niger Republic, have been reunited with their families. ” Leaders of seven bandits’ groups with about 20 to 30 members have already repented and surrendered their weapons while many are underway. “The attacks have stopped, captives released, weapons surrendered, mounting of checkpoints by bandits stopped, all part of the peace agreement reached in the dialogue initiative,” Moyi said. According to him, on the side of government, execution of projects beneficial to communities where the repentant bandits reside had commenced. ”Government has begun to drill boreholes, demarcation of cattle grazing routes, areas and passages and other palliatives,” the commissioner said. Moyi added that the government has also been assisting victims of banditry attacks accommodated in Internally Displaced Persons Camps as well as those that returned to their settlements. He said the government had provided them with food items, clothes, beddings, medicals, farming inputs, and other items to cushion their hardships. According to him, it was a remarkable and unprecedented achievement and appealed to communities as well as the general public to support the peace dialogue. (NAN)
