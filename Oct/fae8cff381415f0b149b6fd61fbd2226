John Charles, Makurdi Benue State Government on Thursday finally arraigned Mr Andrew Ogbuja, a senior lecturer at the Benue State Polytechnic, Ugbokolo, who was alleged to have raped a 13-year-old girl, Ochanya Ogbanje. Ochanya was reported to have died on October 17, 2018 due to complications from the prolonged rape which was alleged to have involved the lecturer and his son, Victor. Mr Ogbuja’s son was said to still be at large when the case was heard at the State High Court, Makurdi. The lecturer was arraigned on four charges bordering on rape and murder. When the charges were  read to the accused, he pleaded not guilty. Following his plea, the prosecuting lawyer, Mr. P. M. Ukande, Deputy Director, Public Prosecution, Benue State, urged the court to remand the defendant and fix a date for trial.

Reacting to the application, the prosecuting counsel said it was “premature to come up with such a request, given the fact that the trial has not fully commenced.” The trial judge, Justice Augustine Ityonyiman, while agreeing with the prosecutor,  overruled the defendant’s application, saying that “it is premature.” Subsequently, the court adjourned the suit to November 14, 2019, for the commencement of trial.
