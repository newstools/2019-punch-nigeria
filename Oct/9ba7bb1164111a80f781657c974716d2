Billionaire Facebook owner, Mark Zuckerberg, has said that he doesn’t think anyone deserves to be as rich as he is. “I don’t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount someone should have. “At some level, no one deserves to have that much money,” he had told his employees during a weekly business conference at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California. According to Yahoo News UK, Zuckerberg, 35, was responding to a worker who asked for his view on US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ statement that “billionaires shouldn’t exist.” He said: “I don’t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount someone should have. At some level, no one deserves to have that much money.

He added he understood Sanders’ point of view. Zuckerberg, who has an estimated wealth of $65bn and is thought to be the world’s fifth-richest man, added: “On some level, it is not fair; but it may be optimal in that it is better than the alternative, which is that the government chooses the funding for all of the scientific research.”
