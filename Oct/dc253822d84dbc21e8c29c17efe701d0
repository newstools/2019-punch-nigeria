Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Kukah, on Monday said that the Emir of Kano Muhammadu Sanusi II is fighting to keep the throne because of his unpopular opinions. He said this on Monday at a panel session held as part of the activities for the 25th Nigerian Economic Summit. The Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje, had created four new emirates in a bid to reduce Sanusi’s influence. Kukah said, “The emir is here, he is still fighting for his life because of the position that he has taken and all of you sitting here know that it has literally become a matter to a particular course because the things he is saying are not popular.” He called for more investments in education. He said,  “The money that comes from the centre to our states, who is it meant for? “When you say education is on the concurrent list, I worry that many of our states are providing opportunities for incubators of hatred to grow. “If you take northern Nigeria where there is no single Christian or woman in the state assembly, women are lucky if they become commissioners for women’s affairs.” Kukah said he understood the importance of education, adding that this was why he had so far established five secondary schools. He said 60 pet cent of the students in his schools are Muslims. The cleric added, “I have five secondary schools and I have to rely on the little collection that I receive in my church to send children to school and in many of the schools, 60 per cent of the children are Muslims.” Copyright PUNCH.
