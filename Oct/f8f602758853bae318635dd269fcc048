The Akarigbo of Remo in Ogun State, Oba Babatunde Ajayi, has counselled embattled musician, Azeez Fashola, aka Naira Marley, to be careful, warning him that he is a person of interest in some quarters. The revered monarch is seen speaking with Marley in a video clip posted by Goldmynetv on its verified Instagram handle on Saturday. The medium reports that Marley paid the monarch a courtesy visit on Friday night after he arrived Sagamu to perform in the 2019 Sagamu Day festival. In what appears very much to be an informal setting, the musician, wearing a white T-shirt with a bag strung across his chest, is ushered into the presence of the Akarigbo, who addresses him as ‘Marlian,’ being the way the musician’s fans address themselves. The monarch exchanges handshake with Marley and another person who seems to have accompanied the musician to the venue. Naira Marley courtesies to the king, after which they appear to have a photograph. It may be recalled that Naira Marley is currently standing trial for alleged conspiracy, possession of counterfeit credit cards and fraud. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission had preferred 11 counts bordering on conspiracy, possession of counterfeit credit cards and fraud against him. At his last court appearance on Thursday, his case was adjourned until December 11. See the video, as posted on Instagram by Goldmynetv:
