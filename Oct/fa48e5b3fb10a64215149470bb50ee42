Okechukwu Nnodim The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has decried the spate of kidnappings across the country saying, its employees had now become key targets of kidnap attempts. NNPC’s Group Managing Director, Mele Kyari, disclosed this while receiving a delegation from the National Institute for Security Studies on Friday in Abuja. He said, “As you are aware, a number of infractions had happened to our assets across the country and our staff members have become key targets of many kidnap attempts and even physical issues around the security of our staff members. “So, security is an issue for us and we are engaging on a number of interventions to ensure the safety of our staff members and material assets.” The NNPC boss said the oil firm had decided to step up its inter-agency collaboration to contain the spate of insecurity of lives and property in the cause of its operations. He added that the security of workers and capital-intensive equipment in the oil and gas industry were critical areas of priority that would always attract the corporation’s management attention.
