Adelani Adepegba, Abuja Barely three weeks after a mob lynched three suspected ‘one chance’ robbers at Dutsen Alhaji, Kubwa, Abuja, another suspected robber was killed a few metres from the Kubwa train station on Tuesday. It was gathered that the deceased and his accomplice attempted to snatch a motorcycle from a commercial rider, but their plot was foiled when their victim raised the alarm, which attracted passers-by. One of the suspected robbers was lynched on the rail track, while his comrade in crime was rescued by the police. Our correspondent, who visited the scene, observed bloodstains on the rail track close to the spot where the deceased was burnt. The incident attracted scores of commercial motorcyclists, who massed on the bridge to catch a glimpse of the suspect’s remains, which were evacuated by the police. The deputy spokesman, Federal Capital Territory Police Command, ASP Miriam Yusuf, said she did not have the details of the incident. Our correspondent reports that mob action has been on the rise in the FCT lately with miscreants meting out instant judgment to suspected criminals. Some commercial motorcyclists had on September 28 attacked a pub in Lugbe and allegedly stole two phones and the sum of N18,000 following the theft of a motorcycle by a passenger, who allegedly spiked the drink of a motorcyclist. Two days before then, some motorcyclists allegedly stabbed to death a motorist, Tosin Abikoye, for knocking down one of them in Lugbe. Abikoye, 33, was said to have been dragged out of a hotel, where he took refuge, and attacked. Copyright PUNCH.
