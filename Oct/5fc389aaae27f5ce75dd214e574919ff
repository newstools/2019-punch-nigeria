Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe Justice Adedayo Akintoye of the Lagos State High Court in Igbosere, on Wednesday, sentenced 46-year-old Tunde Omisakin to 12 years imprisonment for causing the death of his girlfriend, Tina Toroso. Omisakin was arraigned on one count of manslaughter on February 16, 2016, which he pleaded not guilty to and the prosecution called four witnesses to testify against him. Omisakin, on December 8, 2008, around 2am in his place of residence at Lamgbasa in the Ajah area of the state, had used a cutlass to cut the right hand of Toroso, which severed her veins and resulted in her death. Delivering her judgment on Wednesday, Justice Akintoye held that the prosecution was able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, adding that the witnesses called clearly gave evidence establishing how the incident happened. She said, “The prosecution’s evidence directly pointed to the defendant as the person who caused the death of the deceased and the defendant did not deny that he cut her hand, but said he did not intend to kill her. “I hold that the ingredient of manslaughter has been proveed by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence adduced by the investigating officers during investigation cannot amount to hearsay and I hold that the evidence of the prosecution is consistent and therefore reliable.
