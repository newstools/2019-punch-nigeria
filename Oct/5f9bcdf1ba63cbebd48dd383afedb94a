Olufemi Atoyebi, Abuja The Nigeria Medical Association on Sunday called on the Ministry of Health to provide monkey pox vaccine immediately to prevent the outbreak of the disease in Nigeria after a few cases were discovered in some states. In the epidemiological summary of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, which was  posted on its website, the NCDC said in September 2019, 15 new suspected monkey pox cases were reported in Lagos, Rivers, Akwa-Ibom, Zamfara, Delta, Imo and the Federal Capital Territory. Lagos State also on Friday confirmed three reported cases of monkey pox, saying there was no cause for panic. However, in a telephone conversation with our correspondent, the Public Relation Officer of the agency, Jeremiah Agenyi, said there were cases, but was no outbreak of the disease in the state or anywhere in Nigeria yet. In an exclusive interview with our correspondent, the NMA President, Francis Faduyile, advised health workers to have high index of suspicion since some cases had already been reported. He said, “Monkey pox is a special variant of viral illness that we need to, as fast as possible, begin vaccination against. However, between now and when the vaccination will be available, universal precaution is advised. “People should be able to find a way of quarantining those who have the pox and some of the present symptoms. The Ministry of Health should be able to track people who are affected. It is in doing this that we can quickly arrest the spread of this viral illness.” Copyright PUNCH.
