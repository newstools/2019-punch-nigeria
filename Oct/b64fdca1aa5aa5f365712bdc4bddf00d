The Port Harcourt Zonal Director of NOSDRA, Mr. Cyrus Nkangwu, Port Harcourt, who confirmed the development, said the NAOC had reported the oil spill to the agency. He said the area had been cordoned off to prevent further spread, adding that the agency had also deployed its personnel to the oil spill site. “A Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) team is currently at the scene of the incident and would find out the cause of the leak and estimated volume of crude discharged into the environment,” Nkangwu said. The leak is coming barely one month after fire broke out from NAOC’s field in nearby Ubeta community in neighbouring Ahoada-West Local Government Area of Rivers State. The NAOC had claimed that the fire incident was caused by the activities of oil thieves at the oilfield.
