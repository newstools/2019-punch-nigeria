Adelani Adepegba, Abuja A mob, on Monday, lynched three men, who allegedly robbed a woman in a car at Dutse Alhaji, a suburb of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The suspected robbers were stoned to death and their bodies set ablaze with disused tyres. Their operational vehicle was also torched. Posing as passengers in the vehicle, they were said to have robbed their victim and reportedly pushed her out of the moving car. An eyewitness said, “The ‘one chance’ robbers, after taking their victim’s money, phone and other belongings, pushed her out of the vehicle, but some motorcyclists saw them and gave them a hot chase. “They caught up with the robbers under the Dutse Alhaji Bridge. The mob burnt two of them inside their vehicle, while the third one, who attempted to escape into the Dutse Alhaji Market, was also caught and stoned to death. His body was then set ablaze with old tyres and fuel.” It was gathered that the police could not save the deceased as they were overwhelmed by the mob, who insisted on meting out jungle justice on them.
