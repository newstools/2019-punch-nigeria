Friday Olokor, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday commended the Nigeria police for the discovery of what he described as “child-theft racket in Kano State” and “fake correctional centers in Kaduna and Katsina states”, saying he does not support criminality, abduction, child theft, and torture chambers. He told the police to sustain the good efforts across the country, saying they were human rights abuses by individuals and criminal groups. Buhari’s response was contained in a statement by his Special Assistant (Media & Publicity), Garba Shehu. The statement reads, “Reacting to the incidents and arrests, President Buhari notes that such arrests is in line with his commitment to human rights and dignity of the citizens regardless of their age, religion and ethnicity. “President Buhari will not support criminality under any guise, including the abduction of children and selling them off illegally. On torture chambers, in this day and age, no responsible democratic government would tolerate the existence of the torture chambers and physical abuses of inmates in the name of rehabilitation of the victims. “The President, therefore, lauds the efforts of the police in exposing these human rights abuses by individuals and criminal groups and is optimistic that these efforts will be sustained to check illegal activities of this nature. “The President appeals to members of the general public to remain vigilant and assist security agencies in crime prevention and control by reporting the existence of criminal activities around their communities. “The sharing of human intelligence is everybody’s responsibility in order to make our society safe and this government is ever committed to supporting the police to be more effective in the performance of its duties through proper funding and motivation of its personnel.”
