Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta A 39-year-old man, Olakunle Agbaje, has been arrested by men of Ogun State Police Command after allegedly stealing a two-month-old baby from his sleeping mother. Agbaje was reported to have sneaked into the apartment of the woman, Marufu Taiwo, who resides at 32, Odukoya Street, Adesan, in Mowe, Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State. The suspect, who reportedly resided at no 13, Dennis Street, Arigbawonwo, sneaked into Taiwo’s room and took the baby boy from her side while she was sleeping. The Police Public Relations Officer in the State, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this on Monday in a statement. Oyeyemi said the suspect was arrested on Saturday following a distress call received by the Police in Mowe division headquarters. Oyeyemi said, “While the suspect was tiptoeing out of the room, the baby’s mother woke up and raised the alarm, consequent upon which distress call was made to the Police. “On receiving the information, the DPO Mowe Division, Marvis Jayeola, quickly moved to the scene with his men, where the suspect was promptly arrested. “On interrogation, the suspect who first claimed that he strayed into the woman’s room unknowingly, later started begging for mercy with the plea that he didn’t know what pushed him to do what he did.” The PPRO, however, said the Commissioner of Police in the state, Bashir Makama, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspect to the state Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation.
