Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki A young man, identified as Obotti Zion E., who was undergoing his one year National Youth Service Corps in Ebonyi State, has slumped and died at Peace Mass Transit park, Abakaliki. He reportedly slumped and died on Wednesday, October 2, 2019, in the motor park, located along Afikpo Road, Abakaliki, the state capital. The late corps member was said to be an indigene of Cross River State who was serving in Ebonyi. Further investigation revealed that the late Obotti had, on arriving the motor park, gone straight to the ticket section, bought his ticket, and wrote his name in the passengers’ manifest. He then boarded. However, eyewitnesses said, he collapsed and died while still waiting for the bus to fill up. It was further gathered that the management of the transport company had alerted NYSC secretariat, which got to the scene and took him to the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospitality, Abakaliki, where doctors confirmed him dead. Confirming the incident, the NYSC Ebonyi State Coordinator, Mrs. Ann Ibeh, said the death was unfortunate, considering the fact that the deceased had just a few months left to conclude his service year. Asked if autopsy would be conducted on his body, she said the decision belonged to the deceased’s family. Efforts to reach the Ebonyi State Police Command on the incident proved abortive. Calls put to the mobile phone of the Command’s Public Relations Officer, Loveth Odah, were unsuccessful, as her line was not available as of the time of filing this report.
