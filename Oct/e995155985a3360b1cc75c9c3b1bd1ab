A housewife, Mrs. Odunayo Olaniyi, has faked her own kidnap and that of her 10-year-old son, seeking a ransom of half a million naira from her husband. Consequently, a Chief Magistrates’ court sitting in Ilorin on Friday ordered that she be remanded in a correctional centre. The Police arraigned Odunayo Olaniyi, Abdulrauf Folorunso, and Afolabi Adesina on three counts of self-kidnap, false representation and asking for ransom. The Chief Magistrate, Ibrahim Dasuki, who gave the order, also remanded Folorunso and Adesina. Dasuki adjourned the case until October 10 for hearing. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Nasir Yusuf, had told the court that on September 19, the complainant, who is also the defendant’s husband, Segun Olaniyi, who works at the Kwara Road Traffic Management Authority, Ilorin, reported the case at the Anti-Kidnapping Squad, Police Headquarters, Ilorin. Yusuf said Segun told Police that he received a message from his wife, Odunayo, that she had been kidnapped. He alleged that Odunayo also told him that their 10-year-old son had also been kidnapped and that the abductors were demanding for N500,000. Yusuf said that during discreet investigation, the Police discovered that Odunayo, Folorunso and Adesina, had stage-managed the kidnap. The offemce, he said, contravened the provisions of sections 9, 14, and 12 of the Kwara State Prohibition of Kidnapping Law 2010. They pleaded not guilty. (NAN)
