Ademola Babalola The Oyo State Government has said there are certain misconceptions given to the N7.6bn agriculture loan which on Thursday it secured the nod of the state Assembly to access. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde, Mr Taiwo Adisa, on Saturday, said misinformation on the loan facility was an attempt to colour the truth to confuse the public. The statement indicated that the administration of ex-governor Abiola Ajimobi obtained the loan from the Central Bank of Nigeria. The statement read in part, “Governor Makinde is not seeking a fresh loan. The action taken by the House of Assembly of Oyo State on Thursday was to give legislative nod to the state government to access the fund already been domiciled with the government since the days of ex-governor Ajimobi. “The governor’s decision to approach the House of Assembly was a mark of his belief in due process, the rule of law and its processes. Ordinarily, some state executives would have proceeded to spend the funds since it was already in the coffers of the state, but Governor Makinde won’t do that. “Sometimes in 2017, the Central Bank of Nigeria, approved some funds under the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme for disbursement to four states including Ekiti, Osun, Oyo and Abia.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
