Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has labeled the Peoples Democratic Party as a failed opposition party lost in delusions and engaged in fictions. The ruling party also boasted that Nigeria had become the largest rice producer in Africa due to administration’s record investments in agriculture, social investments and infrastructure projects are paying off hugely. A bag of rice now cost between N20, 000 and N25, 000 in the market. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement on Sunday said Nigeria was sadly becoming a one-party state because the PDP had not been able to provide a strong and vibrant opposition in order to deepen democracy. The statement said, “Sadly, Nigeria is becoming a one-party state. As a party that believes in democracy and progressive politics, we cannot pretend any longer. Democracy cannot be said to be fully operational in a situation where the supposed ‘main’ opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party has become a joke, irresponsible and rudderless. “Even as the governing party, we recognise the importance of rigorous and intelligent interrogation of our policies and programmes by the opposition. “There is a lot to gain by our democracy and our country in an atmosphere of robust engagement by responsible and patriotic opposition. The political system we practice has important roles for the political parties outside of power. The system envisaged that such parties would provide alternative viewpoints and put the governing party on its toes.”
