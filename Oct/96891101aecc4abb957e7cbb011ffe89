Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia Monarchs in Orlu, Imo State on Friday appealed to the Federal Government to allow the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, to return to Nigeria for the burial of his mother. The royal fathers made the appeal at Amakwo in the Orsu Local Government Area of Imo State where they honoured the IPOB leader with the title ‘Ihe Africa (The light of Africa).’ The royal fathers, led by Eze Gideon Ejike, said, “Kanu is not a terrorist. Terrorists kill but we have yet to see any bloodshed by Kanu. He is our hero and should be allowed to bury his mother before the beginning of next year. He deserves the honour and right as the first son to bury his mother.” Ezike said they appreciated Kanu because of his sacrifices towards the restoration of Biafra. Ezike said Kanu had brought hope to the oppressed people of South-East and South-South Nigeria, hence the chieftaincy title. In a telephone interview, the monarch said the decision was a collective one, adding, “There was no better way to appreciate him than to confer this chieftaincy title on him. “What Kanu has done for Biafra and indeed Africa cannot be qualified. We don’t have money to pay him for bringing us freedom which we now perceive. “He has fought like a lion, staking his life and everything to liberate the oppressed people. All along, we have been under heavy yoke and oppression by Nigeria until Kanu appeared on the horizon. “Today, we are all convinced that Biafra’s independence is imminent. We decided to give our royal support to the freedom fighter to encourage him to finish the fight. ‘Chukwu Okike Abiama’ (God of all creations) will protect him from enemies.” Copyright PUNCH.
