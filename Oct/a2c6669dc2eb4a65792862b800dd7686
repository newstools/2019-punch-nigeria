Laide said, “The invaders came through the bush, bulldozed their way into the civil defence officer’s home and abducted him, his wife and son. A vigilante (member) who ran into them was shot dead. He has been buried today according to Islamic rites.” The Chairman of Pegi Community Development Association, Mr Taiwo Aderibigbe, confirmed the incident, noting that this showed that “Abuja is under siege.” “Abuja is under siege. That is the truth but sadly, some people are playing politics with our lives, which is uncalled for,” he noted. The FCT police spokesman, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, could not be reached for comment.
