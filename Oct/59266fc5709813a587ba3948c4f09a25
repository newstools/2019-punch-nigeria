Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Imo State Police Command has recovered a four-year-old child stolen from her parents in the Ideato South Local Government Area of the state. The state Commissioner of Police, Rabiu Ladodo, told our correspondent that the baby, Favour Opunwa, was rescued at Ulii in Anambra State by the personnel of his command. Ladodo said, “On September 28, one Chizoba Ngobulu was arrested in Ulii, Anambra State, in connection with a case of child stealing and a four-year-old baby, Favour Opunwa, was recovered from the suspect. “Ngobulu confessed that the baby was given to her by one Philip, who is at large. The baby is sick and has been rushed to the Federal Medical Centre, Owerri, for medical attention. “This child and her younger sibling, who is just two years, were stolen from their parents. We had earlier recovered her younger sibling and arrested six suspects, who confessed that they sold them for N900,000. “The recovery of this girl shows that the two stolen siblings have been recovered and a total of seven suspects arrested. I am happy because I can understand the agony of parents losing two children on the same day.” Ladodo pointed out that the command would not rest until the runaway suspect, Philip, was arrested. He said the suspects would be charged to serve as a deterrent to others, even as he advised parents to be wary of those they allow to come near their children. Copyright PUNCH.
