Maiharaji Altine Repentant bandits in Zamfara State have returned over 1,500 rustled cows to their owners within the last one month in continuation of the peace initiative introduced by the state government. Speaking to our correspondent, the Senior Special Assistant to Governor Bello Matawalle on Security, Alhaji Abubakar Dauran, said the ex-bandits willingly returned the animals in appreciation of the peace accord allowing them to come out of their hideouts and interact with people in the state. He stated, “The cows have since been given to their owners after thorough investigations and interrogation by security agents.’’ Dauran added that four AK 47 riffles were surrendered by the bandits’ Commander, Hassan Dan Tawaye, few days ago, adding that some of the bandits also surrendered the guns in their possession.
