Ekiti State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, on Sunday, declared its readiness to participate in the forthcoming Local Government elections scheduled for December 7. In a statement by the State Publicity Secretary of the Party, Mr Jackson Adebayo in Ado Ekiti, PDP maintained that there was no amount of shenanigan that would stop the party from its resolve to participate in the election. This position has also been corroborated by all the 16 Local Government Chairmen of the party in the state as the party threatens to brand members working secretly against its interest as rebels, with appropriate sanctions awaiting them. The Party described its members calling for a boycott as fifth columnists working for the ruling All Progressives Congress. “We are aware of some fifth columnists among us who, perhaps, are working in collaboration with APC to stop PDP from participation in the election due to public opinions that favour us.

Adebayo, who said that apart from the decision of the State Executive Committee of the Party to participate in the election, the State Working Committee (SWC) had also been up and doing in preparation for the election.
