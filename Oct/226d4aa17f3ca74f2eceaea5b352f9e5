Simon Utebor The Senator Douye Diri Campaign Organisation has called on the Bayelsa State Commissioner of Police to ensure the immediate prosecution of the suspected thugs of the All Progressives Congress who attempted to assassinate the Special Adviser to Governor Seriake Dickson on Youth Affairs, Bobolayefa Owoupele. The Director of Publicity of the SDDCO, Dr Jonathan Obuebite, made the call in a statement on Friday. He said the only way to avert needless violence and killings was for the police and other security agencies to adopt tough measures against perpetrators of political violence. Obuebite said information at the disposal of the team revealed that three of the seven thugs of the APC allegedly involved in the attempted assassination of Owoupele had been arrested and were awaiting prosecution. He commended the state police command for the prompt response to the alleged assault on the peace of the state by arresting three suspects barely 24 hours after the attack. He urged the police to go after the remaining four suspects now at large in order to get them prosecuted to send a strong message to those nursing the evil plot to turn Bayelsa to a war zone because of election.
