Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The family of Kehinde Dada, one of the two students of Federal University, Oye Ekiti, killed during a protest in the school in September, has petitioned the House of Representatives seeking investigations into his death. The family, which expressed sadness over the killing of their son, stated, “Kehinde left Usi Ekiti that early morning for campus but ran into chaos and in the cause of escaping to a nearby house, he was hit by a stray bullet on his right eye and died immediately.” The petition, signed by Morakinyo  Dada, for the family of Mr Adedayo Dada, father of the deceased, dated September 23 and copied to the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu; Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi and the state House of Assembly, was made available to journalists in Ado Ekiti on Tuesday. The family, in the petition, sought investigation into “the circumstances surrounding this extra judicial and unlawful killing-cum-unprofessional conduct of the killer policemen”. It added, “We are also concerned about the ill treatment of the incident by the police authority, knowing the fact that the actions of their personnel fell below globally-acceptable standard operational practice and procedure of security agencies.” The family also wants the lawmakers to “compel the police authority to do the needful on the need to investigate the actions of their personnel on the fateful date. It also seeks the prosecution of the persons behind the killing. The family also wants the House of Representatives to “ensure payment of compensation to the families of the dead and surviving victims’ of the incident”. Copyright PUNCH.
