Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The Vice Chairman of the North-West chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Bishop David Bakare, has said dialogue with bandits  by some governors in the region, will  not end insecurity in the north. The Chairman, who spoke to newsmen in Zaria, Kaduna State, noted that though dialogue was the major process to conflict resolution, it mustn’t overtake the major factor of the conflict. He said, “While there are some criminals that could be engaged in a dialogue, there are others as well who should be compel and subjected to abide by laws.” According to him, the governors had opted to hold a dialogue with bandits without addressing remote causes of banditry and other criminal activities that led to the insecurity in the North. “We have a large army of unemployed youths, both skill and unskilled; there is lack of empowerment package and proliferation of illicit drugs in the North,” he observed. He argued that unless the governors addressed the socio-economic problems affecting their states, the dialogue would not yield any fruit. “We all know that the major cause of banditry, rustling, kidnapping and even Boko Haram is largely economic deprivation against some unprivileged Nigerians, especially youths. “Security issue is a collective effort; it requires a holistic approach and involved all members of the community,” he added.
