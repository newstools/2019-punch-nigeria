Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Abductors of the father of the Bayelsa State Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Doodei Week, have demanded N150m to release their victim. Week was kidnapped by the gunmen from his home at Ayama-Ijaw in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of the state on October 2, 2019. The hoodlums had thrown the Week’s family into fear and anxiety over his safety following their refusal to make any contact with the family, days after whisking him away in a speedboat. The 85-year-old is a second-class traditional ruler and monarch of the Tarakiri clan. The bandits were said to have ransacked his palace and carted away a plasma television as well as two speedboats and a 200-horsepower engine boat belonging to the commissioner at the community’s waterfront. His abduction happened four days after 80-year-old Beauty Siasia, the mother of former Super Eagles’ head coach, Mr. Samson Siasia, was released by her abductors after spending 77 days in their custody. A close family source said the assailants eventually contacted the octogenarian’s family on Monday and demanded N150m for her freedom. The source said, “They contacted the family two days ago (Monday).” Copyright PUNCH.
