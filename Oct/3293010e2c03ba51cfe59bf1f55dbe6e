Tony Okafor, Awka The Inspector General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu, on Friday said the major problem confronting the Police in the country was the social media. He said policing Nigeria in a social media era was difficult. Adamu stated this at the end of a workshop on Police Public Relations Officers of the 36 states and Federal Capital Territory in Agulu, Anambra State. He said, “Things are no longer the same; technology has changed the terrain, especially in communication, and today, we have several means of communication. “Social media can make or mar your job. As Police public relations officers, your job is to polish the image of the Police; so, you must be acquainted with the various means of communication. “You do not only have the print and electronic media to contend with, but also, social media. “Policing is made difficult by the social media; so, you have to be up and doing and be acquainted with the use of social media. “You can use the social media to your advantage, and it can also be used against you by mischief makers.” Adamu cautioned the PPROs not to reply to fake news materials which he said, most times, are peddled to attract unnecessary attention. “Sometimes, it is better not to respond, and if you don’t, the originators of such fake news will be frustrated, and they will back out. “Sometimes, the mischief makers originate fake news to make you react to it. So, as they are skillful, you too have to be skillful, and that is the essence of this workshop.”
