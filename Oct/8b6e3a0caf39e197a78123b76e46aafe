No fewer than 40 villages have been sacked by flood in Adamawa State. The News Agency of Nigeria reported the Executive Secretary, Adamawa State Emergency Management Agency, Dr Muhammad Sulaiman, as saying heavy downpour recorded in the last three days caused the situation. Sulaiman said the majority of the affected villages were on the bank of River Benue, with farmland and houses being destroyed. He said the situation was saddening because barely two months ago, 15 people died due to flooding, hundreds were displaced while hectares of farmland and domestic animals were lost. “Now again, within the last three days, over 40 villages in five local government areas have been overrun by flood. “The affected local government areas are Fufore, Yola South, Demsa, Numan and Girei,” Sulaiman said. He urged the federal and humanitarian agencies who promised assistance to the victims of the August flooding to redeem their pledge.
