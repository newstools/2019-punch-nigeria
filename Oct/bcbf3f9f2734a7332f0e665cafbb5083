Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State House of Assembly has called for investigation into the alleged contamination of underground water on St. Finbarrs Road, Akoka, by fuel leakage. The lawmaker representing Shomolu Constituency 1, Rotimi Olowo, who moved the motion for the investigation, noted that the water in the area had been contaminated by Premium Motor Spirit, which could cause a fire disaster in the community. Olowo, who stated that efforts of government agencies involved in the situation had not yielded any result, noted that the source of the contamination could be from a petrol station in the community. He said, “It is evident that the water in the area is highly contaminated. They went ahead to have a water analysis which showed that the permissible and allowed limit is 0.05 by DPR, but what the analysis showed was that it varied between 3.5 per cent, which is highly dangerous and it is capable of mutilating the gene of the younger ones that have been exposed to this water for the past two years. It is capable of damaging their DNA, in addition to all other health issues.” Another member of the House, Shokunle Olusola, noted that if the issue was not attended to by the House, it would not only affect the residents, but also their unborn children. “Drinking water that is polluted with hydrocarbon is as good as drinking poison,” he added. The Speaker of the House, Mudashiru Obasa, directed the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency and Ministry of Environment and Water Resources to investigate the area to clarify and establish facts concerning the issue.
