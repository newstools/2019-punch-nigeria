Nike Popoola The Federal Government and Lagos State Government have given their support to the Central Bank of Nigeria and the banks on their move to transform the National Theatre. This was disclosed during an assessment visit by some executives of the banking industry and government officials to the National Theatre in Iganmu on Saturday towards the creation of a creative industry park. The CBN and the banks had expressed their determination to give the National Theater a facelift when it is officially handed over to them by the government. Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwoolu, said the development would turn the National Theatre into a tourist zone and a place for youths to exhibit their skills. He said, “We have worked around this entire land area in the national edifice called the National Art Theatre. What we have come to ascertain for ourselves is to also appreciate the extent of an asset that has been conceived as a non-earning asset, but I there say that Mr President has been gracious to give the go-ahead and turn this dead asset into an income-earning state of the art developed fashion entertainment industry.” The CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, said the National Theatre could have a convention centre that would be far better than what was obtainable in many countries. He said the CBN was committed to giving the youths the opportunity to succeed in their different businesses through its Creative Industry Financing Initiative. “This place can stand any world-class convention center you can think about. We thank the Lagos State Government, the Federal Government, Federal Ministry of Information and Culture for giving us the opportunity to come in here to develop it for the good of Nigeria and Nigerians.”
