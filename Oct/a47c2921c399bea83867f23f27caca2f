Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The Kogi State House of Assembly has impeached the embattled Deputy Governor, Simon Achuba. His impeachment followed the submission earlier in the day of the report of the committee set up by the state chief judge, Justice Nadir Ajana, to investigate an allegation of gross misconduct against the former deputy governor. Leader of the House, Hassan Bello Abdulahi, representing Ajaokuta state constituency who announced the decision of the House, said Achuba stands impeached after careful consideration of the report of the John Bayeshea committee submitted earlier on Friday.

The committee was set up in August following allegations of gross misconduct leveled against the Deputy Governor when he accused  Governor Yahaya Bello of withholding his salaries and imprests since 2017 — an allegation denied by the government during hearing by the committee. The Director General, Media and Publicity to the Kogi State Governor, Kingsley Fanwo, also accused the embattled Deputy Governor of attempting to set the state on fire. Fanwo alleged that the Achuba was orchestrating violence and incitement against the governor and the government of Kogi State.”
