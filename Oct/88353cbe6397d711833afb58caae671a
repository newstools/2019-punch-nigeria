Peter Dada, Akure Four persons suspected to be kidnappers were arrested by the security men in Ajowa Akoko, Akoko North-West Local Government Area of Ondo State on Friday. The suspected bandits who were reportedly arrested by the joint team of security men and local hunters were alleged to be terrorising the people of the local government in recent times. Prior to their arrest, it was gathered that the bandits allegedly kidnapped one Muslim cleric,  Alhaji Jamiu Zakariyahu, last Wednesday but the victim escaped after spending 24 hours in the captivity and informed the security men who later arrested the hoodlums. A source said, “They ( bandits) pushed him down on a motorcycle and immediately put a mask to cover his face and led him to the bush. “They demanded a ransom of N10 million which they later reduced to N5 million. The negotiating team told the captors that he is a teacher whose family can’t pay more than N250,000 which they agreed to collect. “‘Miraculously in the second night at the captivity, Alhaji Zakariyahu escaped while the kidnappers had slept off. The security men and the local hunters swung into action and arrested one Wasiu Mohammed, who led them to the arrest of the three others while other members of the gang  fled.” The Ikare Area Commander of the police, Mr.  Rasak Rauf, who confirmed the arrest warned the people of the area against allowing unknown faces to stay in the town. It was gathered that the suspects had been taken to Akure by soldiers.
