Chidiebube Okeoma The Minority Leader of the Imo State House of Assembly, Ekene Nnodumele, has raised the alarm over the menace of flooding in his constituency – Orsu Local Government Area of the state. Nnodumele, a member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, who moved a motion of urgent public importance during the plenary, told his colleagues that no fewer than 45 houses had been submerged by floods in Obibi, Awo Idemili community in the Orsu LGA. He urged his colleagues to support the motion which urged the governor, Emeka Ihedioha, to mandate the relevant state government agencies to move to the community. The minority leader said if nothing was done urgently, the flooding would affect other neighbouring communities. Nnodumele said the government’s intervention would bring reprieve to many who had been rendered homeless by the floods. He said, “I raised the motion on the floor of the House of Assembly urging the state government under Governor Emeka Ihedioha to direct the relevant agencies to urgently move to Obibi, Awo Idemili in Orsu LGA in a bid to rescue lives and property due to the disaster that has devastated the community. “This intervention would bring succour to the displaced persons affected by the floods.” Copyright PUNCH.
