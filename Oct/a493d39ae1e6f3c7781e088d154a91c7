The Anambra State police command on Monday said that it had arrested 74 persons for alleged criminal offences, including child trafficking, within the month. Mr Haruna Muhammed, the Public Relations Officer for the command made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Awka. He urged parents to be proactive about the safety of their children and other persons under their care. Muhammed said that the advice became necessary, considering the rate of crime in society and how people betray the trust reposed in them.

The command’s spokesman said that the suspects included three women allegedly involved in child trafficking and some fake military men, allegedly terrorising residents of the state. “We are able to rescue two children between the ages of two and four from the child traffickers through the combined efforts of joint security teams in the state,” he said. The PPRO said that the suspects were arrested through intelligence report and attributed the success of the command to the launch of Operation Mkpochapu (Cleanup) in the state. He said that the command was committed to fighting crime in the state and ensure adequate security of lives and property of the people. “We appeal that security tips must be observed at all times to aid the police in doing their work very well. “We also urge the public to share useful information with the command to enable us to perform effectively,” Mohammed said. He said that one of the suspected child traffickers confessed that she sold her child and niece because of hardship, “a decision she took without seeking her sister’s permission,” he said. (NAN)
