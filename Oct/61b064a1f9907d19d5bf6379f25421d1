Fourteen people were killed on Wednesday when an illegal gold mine collapsed in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the government said, giving a provisional toll. “Fourteen dead, three hospitalised with serious injuries. Search continuing,” Steve Mbikayi, the minister of national solidarity and humanitarian action, said in a tweet. The accident happened at Kampene, 180 kilometres (110 miles) south of the town of Kindu. A civil society campaigner, Justin Kyanga Asumani, also giving a preliminary toll, said: “15 bodies have been recovered, including two women.” READ ALSO: Buhari mourns Babalola, NSCIA’s Deputy President General Deadly accidents are frequent in DR Congo’s informal mining sector, especially in gold. Safety is poor and risk-taking is high. Subsistent miners rush to an area where valuable minerals are discovered, often digging deep shafts that then collapse. Kyanga said the accident happened at around 2 pm, when “dozens of people, including children and pregnant women” were at work on the site. In June, more than 40 illegal miners died at a copper concession in Kolwezi, southeastern DR Congo, that was operated by Kamoto Copper Company (KCC), a subsidiary of Swiss company Glencore. Kyanga said the illegal mine in Kampene had been operating for around a decade, a situation that underscored “the lack of oversight and the inactivity by state bodies”. (AFP)
