The Ebonyi State Emergency Management Agency on Friday said flood displaced over 30,000 people, including children in six local government areas of the state. The agency’s Acting Executive Secretary, Mr Chibueze Iteshi, told the News Agency of Nigeria in Abakaliki that the flood submerged farmlands, livestock and houses. Iteshi said, “About 30,000 persons are currently displaced by flood across the state. It affected infants, children from one to 12 years, adults from 18 to 49, 50 and above at the camps. “When the disaster occurred, about 95 per cent of the children stopped schooling because the school structures might have been affected. “There were fears that the roofs of the school buildings might have been blown off by storm. The schools appeared to be no longer accessible to the children.” He said the Nigerian Metrological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency had predicted heavy rains. Iteshi said the children were in different nursery, primary and secondary schools in the affected LGAs. He appealed to UNICEF to come to the aid of the children, adding that they were finding it difficult to cope with the displacement. According to him, the agency has commenced inventory of the affected persons and communities. He also disclosed that the agency inaugurated 13 local emergency committees across the state to mitigate the effect of flooding in communities.
