No fewer than six buildings and shops were burnt on Wednesday at Upper Iweka, on Onitsha/Awka Road in Onitsha, after a 33,000-litre diesel tanker fell and caught fire. The Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Commission, Anambra Command, Mr Andrew Kumapayi, confirmed this to News Agency of Nigeria in Awka. He stated that the incident occurred at around 12:44 p.m. Kumapayi said that the Fire Service Officials got to the scene of the fire promptly but could not put out the fire as their water pump developed a fault. “The tanker lost control due to brake failure, the head of the vehicle pulled out while the tank containing diesel fell into the gutter spilling its content on the road and it caught fire due to the spill.

Kumapayi warned tanker owners and drivers to ensure that their vehicles were in good condition before plying the roads. “The saving grace was the road bumps constructed by the state government; it prevented the tanker from ramming into buildings around the area,” he said. Kumapayi said that policemen and FRSC officials were on ground to maintain order and ensure the free flow of traffic. (NAN)
