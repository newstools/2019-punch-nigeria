Tony Okafor, Awka The corpses of two persons killed in the Onitsha tanker fire in Anambra State have been abandoned in a hospital they were rushed to after the incident. Some persons were admitted to the hospital; while six were treated and discharged, two were still in the hospital. Those still in the hospital, it was gathered, were Blessing Egbogu and Oluchukwu Ani from Imo and Enugu states respectively. The Medical Director of the hospital, Dr Emeka Eze, stated this while briefing a 2021 governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dr Obiorah Okonkwo, who visited the hospital. Eze said the victims’ bills would be settled by the Anambra State Government. Okonkwo, who visited the hospital and the burnt Ochanja Market, gave the patients financial support and promised that his Foundation, the Pro-value Humanity Foundation, would procure an ambulance for the market. Addressing the traders at Ochanja, Okonkwo said, “It could have been worse considering the magnitude of destruction. “The amenities in Onitsha must be upgraded and the infrastructure properly secured. There is no security here, which to me, is a human error. Onitsha markets should be redesigned and provided with its needs.” Copyright PUNCH.
