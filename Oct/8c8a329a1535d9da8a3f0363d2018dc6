A Florida man, Richard Dennis, shot dead his son-in-law, Christopher Bergan, 37, who had knocked on his door at 11:30 p.m. as part of a surprise move for his  (Dennis) birthday the next day. According to Washington Post, upon hearing the knock, Dennis, 61, had gripped a gun as he stepped outside his home in Gulf Breeze, Florida. When he saw a person jump out of the bushes, he pulled the trigger. It was only then, that he realised it was his son-in-law. Bergan had come to the US from Norway, where he and his wife live.
