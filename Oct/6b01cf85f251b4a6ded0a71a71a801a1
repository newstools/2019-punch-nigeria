Sampson Itode , Port Harcourt A non-governmental organisation, Ogoni Liberation Initiative, has demanded compensation from Shell Petroleum Development Company arising from the ecological and economic damages occasioned by oil pollution in Ogoniland. The group stated this in Bori, in the Khana Local Government Area of Rivers State on Saturday while presenting an Ogoni environment evaluation report to the people concerning the level of damages and the amount needed to pacify the people of the area. President of the group, Douglas Fabeke, explained that compensation was the only way to assuage the “crushed spirit” of the people and engender peace and development in the area. He said, “We came up with this report because we have done an extensive research in Africa, as well as other countries around the world where oil pollution has affected their environments similar to the Ogoni situation and what brought about peace in those areas was compensation.”Copyright PUNCH.
