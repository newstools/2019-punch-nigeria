The National Identity Management Commission has advised all 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination candidates not yet enrolled for the National Identification Number to visit any NIMC office nationwide and enrol. Mr Chuks Onyepunuka, the Information Technology/Identity Database Officer, NIMC gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Wednesday in Abuja. According to Onyepunuka, NIN is mandatory for the UTME examination, hence obtaining the NIN qualifies candidates for its registration. In June, the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board stated that starting from the year 2020, UTME/Direct Entry candidates will register for its examinations with their NIN to solve the challenges of multiple registrations.
