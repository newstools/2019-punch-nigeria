Oladimeji Ramon Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has assured the people of the state that the 2020 budget of the state would capture the requests they made during town hall meetings held across the three senatorial districts of the state. Abiodun, according to a statement on Thursday, made this pledge during the town hall meeting in Ogun East. “I assure all that this is not just a talk show. Your views and inputs will be incorporated into the 2020 budget estimates and will subsequently manifest in desired outcomes in each of the three senatorial districts,” the governor said. He explained that as opposed to the past practice, he decided to decentralise the town hall to achieve inclusiveness. He said, “That (past) situation puts, at a disadvantage, our women and youths who form the higher percentage of our population.” Copyright PUNCH.
