*Says there wasn’t any law against it Friday Olokor, Abuja The Federal Government on Wednesday announced plans to ensure the return of toll gates on federal highways in the country. The decision came after being phased out more than a decade ago. The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, stated this while briefing State House Correspondents on the decision taken at the Federal Executive Council meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Council Chamber, Presidential Villa Abuja. Fashola, flanked by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said there was no law that stopped the government from having toll gate on federal roads. He said, “There is no reason why we can’t toll, there was a policy of government to abolish tolls or as it where, dismantle toll plaza but there is no law that prohibits tolling in Nigeria today. We expect to return toll plazas, we have concluded their designs of what they will look like, what materials they will be rebuilt with, what new considerations must go into them. “What we are looking at now and trying to conclude is how the bank end runs.” READ ALSO: Periodic election alone is not democracy — Goodluck Jonathan Fashola said that government was also considering to eliminate payment of cash by introducing electronic mode of payment.
