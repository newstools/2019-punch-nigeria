Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has announced the death of his mother, Ugoeze Sally Kanu. Kanu made the announcement on Sunday in a video he posted on his Facebook page, which revealed that Ugoeze Kanu passed on in Germany on August 30, 2019. He described his mother as loving, caring and a compassionate woman. He also said she died as a result of the trauma she faced when Nigerian soldiers stormed their Afaraukwu home in Umuahia, the capital of Abia State on September 14, 2017 during the Operation Python Dance exercise. The IPOB leader claimed that her mother, seeing how soldiers slaughtered people in their compound got traumatised and took ill, which unfortunately she never recovered from. He however stated that Biafra remained the most critical and important thing, adding that his mother had been sacrificed to ensure it became a reality. He said, “Today, I announce the passing of my mother, Ugoeze Sally Nmeme Kanu. May Chukwu Okike Abiama grant her eternal rest.” Copyright PUNCH.
