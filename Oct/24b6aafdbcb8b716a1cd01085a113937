The Zone Rs 5 Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps said on Friday that 278 deaths were recorded in Edo, Delta and Anambra states between January and September this year. The Commanding Officer of the zone, Mr Kehinde Adeleye, made the disclosure in Benin in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria. Adeleye said that 1,492 people were also injured in 492 road accidents recorded within the period. He said about 157 cases were recorded as fatal, while 283 cases were documented as serious with 52 cases reported as minor. The commander explained, however, that between July and September, about 90 people were reported killed in the zone in 168 road accidents with 481 people injured. Adeleye said the zone had put machinery in motion to ensure a drastic reduction in road crashes in the remaining months of this year. He said the command would collaborate with other agencies to curb road traffic crashes drastically. He said, “The command has sought the intervention of the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency and the Federal Ministry of Works to fix bad spots on the highways. “The command has also been talking with governors in the three states to repair failed portions of roads to prevent accidents.” Copyright PUNCH.
