Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The fora of the All Progressives Congress states’ chairmen in the South-East and the South-South have backed President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive that a forensic audit be conducted on the account of the Niger Delta Development Commission. The fora, in two statements in Abuja on Sunday, also called on Buhari to urgently inaugurate a new board to superintend over the commission’s activities for a holistic review and reforms. The statements were signed by the leader of the South-South chairmen and Akwa-Ibom APC chairman, Ini Okopido, and his Abia State counterpart, Donatus Nwankpa, who is the leader of the South-East chairmen of the forum, respectively. The fora urged President Muhammadu Buhari to inaugurate those already appointed on the board of the commission. “The forum is of the view that since neither the Chairman nor Managing Director designate of the newly constituted NDDC board has served in the commission in the period 2001 to 2019 in reference, they will be able to dispassionately carry out reforms that will revamp the commission and correct the inadequacies of the previous boards vis-a-viz address the infrastructural decay in the region,” the statement said.
