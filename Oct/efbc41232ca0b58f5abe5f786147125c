Patrick Odey, Uyo The Eket Field Office of the Department of Petroleum Resources has sealed eight Liquefied Petroleum Gas plants not approved by it. The plants were sealed during a routine surveillance operation by the department on Wednesday. The Head of Operations, DPR, Eket Field Office, Mr Joy Koro, who stated this in Uyo, said the  affected plants commenced the storage and sale of the commodity without due approval. Koro said, “Today’s operation is based on routine surveillance of the LPG plants; we are checking compliance with our safety standards, current storage and sales licences and illegal gas plants that have been installed without our approval. “The critical distance from the adjoining structures fell below our approved regulation.” He added that the department had forced some of the LPG plants to stop work and ordered their owners to remove them, noting that it would have no option but to use security agents to enforce compliance. “And if they refuse, we will write the security agencies to prosecute them accordingly,” Koro stated.
