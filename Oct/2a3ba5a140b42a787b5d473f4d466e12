The Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, has finally dismissed embattled senior lecturer in the Department of Pure and Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Physical Sciences, Peter Ekemezie. The PUNCH gathered on Wednesday that the Anambra State indigene’s claims to a master’s degree and PhD from UNIZIK were also dismissed by the school. The development followed a series of investigations into the fraudulent academic records of Ekemezie, which had been covered up for about nine years by top officers of the school.
