He, however, did not indicate in his letter that he had defected to the opposition All Progressives Congress as was the case of the other aides who quit before him. Giving reasons for resigning his position, Fefegha said, “After a period of deep reflection, I have decided to quit due to political uncertainty and other reasons personal to me. “I hope to dedicate my life and energy to other assignments that will be more acceptable to God and humanity in the near future. “I cannot thank you enough for the various positions you graciously assigned me to collaborate and work with towards the goals of the Restoration Agenda in Bayelsa State. “It has been incredibly rewarding to have traversed almost all the gamut of the State Executive Council.”
