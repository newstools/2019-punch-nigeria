Abiodun Nejo The All Progressives Congress  Elders’ Forum in Ekiti State on Saturday hailed the restoration of the Social Welfare Scheme for the Elderly by Governor Kayode Fayemi. The social security scheme under which Fayemi paid N5,000 monthly to elders in the state during his first term, was on Wednesday reintroduced and the stipend was increased to N20,000 per beneficiary per quarter. Ekiti APC Elders’ Chairman, Chief George Akosile and Secretary, Chief Abiodun Ajayi, said the stipends which the governor had restored for the elderly “would contribute in a large way to eradicating poverty and better the lots of people in the state.” The elders, in statement in Ado Ekiti in which they congratulated Fayemi on his first year in office, praised the governor for his interventions in attracting socio-economic development to the state, noting that prompt payment of salaries and pensions had improved the state economy. The statement reads, “While commending the efforts of Dr Fayemi for the wonderful strides, we also hail him for restoration of the payment of stipend for the elderly. This gesture will go a long way in enhancing the well-being of the elders and end poverty in the state. Copyright PUNCH.
