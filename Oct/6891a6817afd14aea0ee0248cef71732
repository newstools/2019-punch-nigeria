Oladimeji Ramon The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has  said the state government will  sue the Niger Delta Development Commission and its contractors  for the  alleged shoddy road projects executed in the state. The governor, who blamed flooding in parts of Edo State on shoddy road projects by the NDDC contractors, said the state would seek legal redress for the affected residents. Obaseki, according to a statement on Tuesday, said this during an on-the-spot assessment of abandoned roads in Edo State by the House of Representatives Ad Hoc Committee on NDDC Abandoned Projects. Making reference to the Apostolic Street, off Sakponba Road, Benin, where residents lost valuables due to flooding, Obaseki said, “The contractor did the asphalt work on the road without taking into consideration the fact that there were manholes to channel water in the area. When the community advised the contractor not to block the manholes, he disregarded the advice and blocked them. You can see the devastation that has caused? “We are holding the NDDC and the contractor liable and we will take legal actions to ensure they compensate the victims affected.” The leader of the House ad hoc committee, Sergius Ogun, said there was no sign of the projects awarded in 2012 by the NDDC for execution in Edo State.
