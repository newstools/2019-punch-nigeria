Oladimeji Ramon A non-governmental organisation, Laws and Rights Awareness Initiative, has urged the Federal High Court in Lagos to compel the Lagos State Government to shut down or relocate its dumpsite in the Olusosun area of Ojota. The group, in its suit marked FHC/L/CS/1726/19, complained that the Olusosun dumpsite was posing a threat to and infringing on the fundamental rights to life and human dignity of its members. Their lawyer, Olumide Babalola, contended that the refusal of Lagos State to shut down or relocate the Olusosun dumpsite amounted to a violation of sections 33 and 34 of the Nigerian constitution as well as Articles 16 and 24 of the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights.
