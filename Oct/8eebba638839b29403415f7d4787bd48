Tony Okafor, Awka The outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra has said the Wednesday Onitsha tanker fire disaster was a terrorist attack. In a statement by IPOB’s Media and Public Secretary, Emma Powerful, the group said the consistency with which such mishaps happened in the southern part of the country had clearly shown that they were being executed by certain persons. While sympathising with those who lost their loved ones and property in the inferno, the group said nobody should be deceived that such incidents were mere accidents. It wondered why such incidents were not happening in certain parts of the country where even the owners of such articulated vehicles allegedly hail from.

It is time now for our people to wake up to this new reality of population reduction.”
