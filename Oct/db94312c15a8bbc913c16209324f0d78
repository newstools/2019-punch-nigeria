It was gathered that the people who attacked Felix entered the school premises through a bush path, while some were also around the main campus in Calabar to monitor the victim’s movement. A source said, “The assailants numbering about five came into the school from a neighbouring community and laid ambush for their victim before striking. “They shot him many times; after he fell down, they cut his neck and with machetes. They later escaped through the same bush path they came.” The institution’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Onen Onen, confirmed the incident.
