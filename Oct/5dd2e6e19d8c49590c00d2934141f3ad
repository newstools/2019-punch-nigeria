John Charles, Makurdi Two bandits were on Saturday shot dead by operatives of the Joint Task Force of the Operation Zender in the Kwande Local Government Area of Benue State. According to police sources, the bandits were killed by men of the Operation Zender led by SP Justine Gbyindye along the Ugbema-Jarto-Akar Road. The bandits were said to have confronted the police personnel, who were on surveillance in the area. A source at the Benue State Police Command said, “Members of the Joint Task Force of the Operation Zenda were on surveillance in the volatile area when the bandits engaged them in a gun duel leading to some of the gang members fleeing with gunshot wounds. “In the process, members of the task force killed two of the bandits, who were suspected to be members of the notorious kidnapping and armed robbery gang terrorising the neighbouring communities.” The personnel of the task force were responsible for the discovery of 16 shallow graves a few weeks ago as well as the remains of a policeman’s wife, who was killed and buried in a rice farm in the Ukum Local Government Area of the state a week ago. Items recovered from the gang, according to a police source, were a submachine gun, live ammunition, cartridges, phones and charms. The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stated that the police were on the trail of the fleeing members of the gang, adding that they would soon be brought to justice. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Catherine Anene, confirmed the killing of the bandits. “Yes, at Ugbana on the Jarto-Aka Road, two bandits were gunned down when they exchanged fire with the police,” she stated.
