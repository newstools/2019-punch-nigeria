Success Nwogu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party on Wednesday said the decision of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress administration to “further squeeze Nigerians” by imposing a N5,000 fee for national identity card is “repressive.” The party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said it rejected the decision. Ologbondiyan stated that the idea of the ID Card fee by the Buhari administration was “insupportable, reprehensible and completely offensive to the sensibilities of Nigerians as free citizens.” According to him, imposing “such unwarranted levy” on Nigerians for internal social safety instrument amounted to “wicked fleecing” as well as stripping them of their constitutional rights in their own nation. He warned that issuance of national identity card to citizens, as an obligation of the state to its citizenry, must remain free as established by the PDP. He urged the Buhari government to immediately rescind the N5,000 levy “before it triggers restiveness in the nation.” Ologbondiyan said, “Already, the fee is generating tension in the country as Nigerians have continued to register their rejection in the public space. “The PDP notes the increasing penchant of the APC administration to impose all sorts of taxes on suffering Nigerians. “Only recently, the Buhari-led APC administration increased the Value Added Tax on goods and services from five per cent to 7.5 per cent. “This is in addition to increase in tariffs for electricity and other services as well as the obnoxious decision to return the tollgates on our major highways. “Our party cautions that such impositions breed resentment and erode the much-desired patriotism; leading to the escalation of social vices and low commitment to nation building by citizens. “The PDP therefore charges President Buhari to direct the National Identity Management Commission to immediately cancel its decision to levy Nigerians for national identity cards.”
