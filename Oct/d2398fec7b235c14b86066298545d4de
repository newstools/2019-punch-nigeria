Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The Buhari Media Organisation has said President Muhammadu Buhari’s attendance at summits and other international fora is in the best interest of the country. The group said the visits aimed at exploring and expanding opportunities in security, trade and investment, science and technology, agriculture, transportation and oil & gas production, to mention a few. The BMO made this observation in a reaction to criticisms from some quarters on the President’s trip to Saudi Arabia to attend the economic forum of the Future Investment Initiative. In a statement signed by its Chairman, Niyi Akinsiju, and  Secretary, Cassidy Madueke, the group said that these meetings were no ordinary gatherings but avenues to attract potential investors and showcase the economic opportunities that abound in the country. The statement said, “As President Buhari makes a three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia to strengthen the diplomatic, trade and economic relations between the two countries, some had condemned the trip as unnecessary since the President just came back from Russia few days ago after a successful Russia-Africa summit. “The summit was aimed at strengthening bilateral relations in areas such as solid minerals, reviving steel rolling mills (Ajaokuta and Aladja), rail transportation, security cooperation, oil and gas, agriculture (Wheat production and fertilizer) and education, to mention a few. “It is worthy of note that the President is not only visiting and signing MOUs, but the MOUs are also being realised in physical projects such that in 2018 $8bn came into Nigeria as Foreign Direct Investment with 65 projects across the country.” The BMO said the president was working to strengthen diplomatic relations, trade and the security of our nation and deserved commendation from all rather than criticisms. The statement added, “We recall also that President Buhari’s working visit to China last year yielded additional investments in Nigeria exceeding $6bn. A total of $1bn is to be invested in the development of a Greenfield expressway for Abuja-Ibadan-Lagos. Similarly, Mambilla Hydro Power Project, which is capable of generating about 2,600 Mw of electricity will, when completed, be the biggest dam in Africa. Like the rail project, the Mambilla Hydro Project was conceived several years ago, precisely in 1982. “President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to Morocco has helped to revive abandoned Nigeria fertiliser blending plants. So far, 18 plants have been revitalised under the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative, with a total capacity of about three million metric tonnes of fertiliser which has created about 50,000 jobs across the value chains of Agriculture. “President Muhammadu Buhari also signed nine different agreements, including the Extradition Treaty between Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates aimed at strengthening Nigeria’s anti-corruption campaign, Transfer of Sentenced Persons, Mutual Legal Assistance on Criminal Matters and Mutual Legal Assistance on Criminal and Commercial Matters, which include the recovery and repatriation of stolen wealth.”
