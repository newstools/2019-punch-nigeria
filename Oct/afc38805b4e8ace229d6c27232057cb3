Onyekachukwu Meluwa -Warri. A man simply identified as William has been reportedly killed as Aladja and Ogbe-Ijoh communities in Udu and Warri South-West Local Government Area of Delta State resumed an age-long crisis. What led to the resumed dispute was yet to be ascertained as of the time of filing this report. Our correspondent gathered that the victim, a tailor, was said to have been shot dead in his house by suspected armed youths from Aladja community. The Ijaw Youth Council Chairman in the Ogbe-Ijoh Warri Kingdom, Comrade (Engr.) Smart Okosun, confirmed the report to our correspondent on the telephone. He said, “William was shot dead in his house by Aladja youths this afternoon in Ogbe-Ijoh.” However, the President of Aladja Community Council, Elder Otto Ogbiruveta, who also spoke to our correspondent on the telephone said, “For now, I cannot tell you anything because I am not in town. I am out of town. When I come, I will have to investigate first before I can say anything.” The incident has caused serious tension within the two neighbouring communities who had just concluded a celebration together. When contacted, the Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Adeyinka Adeleke, confirmed the report. Adeleke said, “My men are there now. I learnt one man was shot dead in his house. “That is what caused the crisis but we don’t have the particulars of the man who was shot dead. But we have to be careful so that we don’t escalate the crisis.”
