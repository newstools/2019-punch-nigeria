Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Monday, honoured the Divisional Police Officer of the Ogudu Police Station, Celestine Kalu, for saving the life of a robbery victim. The victim, Friday Ajabor, was on September 19, around 8pm, waylaid by a two-man gang who disposed him of his valuables and shot him in the abdomen. Policemen from Ogudu Police Station, led by officer Kalu arrived at the scene and rushed the victim to two hospitals where he was rejected. The victim was reportedly admitted in the Intensive Care Unit of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital in Ikeja, where he underwent surgery, the cost of which was paid by the DPO. Sanwo-Olu, who stated that the officer’s act caught his attention after going viral on social media, noted that she went beyond the limit of her official duty to save the life of the robbery victim. He said, “I am personally amazed by this rare act of kindness displayed by Mrs Celestina Kalu, who went beyond the official call of duty to save the life of a citizen using her personal resources. This is one of the essences of governance and public service when you have public officers going beyond the call of duty to render a helping hand to a fellow citizen. “When we see law enforcement officers giving us reasons to be kind, we need to appreciate and recognise such actions. This is why we are honouring Mrs Kalu as our role model. This will encourage others to emulate this act of kindness.” The governor, while urging security agencies to scale up their surveillance across the state, presented a plaque bearing the official seal of the Lagos State Government to honour the DPO and also took over the cost of Ajabor’s surgery.
