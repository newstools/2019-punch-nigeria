The photograph and video clip of a naked woman identified as Ene has led to cyber brickbats on Twitter. The inglorious video of the woman when she was naked, and later, wrapped in white cloth as if dead, have sent Nigerians talking. It was alleged by online reports that she was thrown out of a moving car. It appears as if there are two photographs, though, as the skin shades of what seems to be two ladies appear to differ. One of the photographs is, however, too gory to be used on decent forum. In a photograph where a lady is stark naked, she is light skinned, with extensive tattoos on her arms, and wearing long wig. The other photograph is subdued, with the woman, whose skin appears dark, lying down and covered in white cloth. Twitter comments insist that it is one and same individual. The incident is said to have happened in Ajah area of Lagos, with no particular reference to street or any useful information. Solomon Buchi, with Twitter handle @Solomon_Buchi had tweeted what appeared to be an insider knowledge of “Ene”: “Pls help. This is Ene. She is HIV positive. If you stay in Ajah, you’ll see her naked with people throwing stones and hurling insults at her. My friend rushed her to took her from the road to LUTH, trying to get her medical care. LUTH is delaying. Pls retweet. We need to save her.” The Tweet soon attracted reactions, with some people disproving Mr. Buchi’s claim. One of such is Adetoro Usman @mcadexbanty_u, who responded: “I can boldly tell you from Dis picture was clearly different from D lady dat was dropped a Ajah Yesterday. “Secondly don’t mislead people bcos of sympathy & also portraits others people as wicked being bcos D Lady at Ajah yday evening wasn’t stoned by anyone. I’m an eye witness” Mrs Good hair..@_Debstar responded:  DéKunlè @AbdurBello counters: “Nobody threw stone at her oooo…. People just gathered there and snapping and recording… That was all oooo.” So far, no agency of the Lagos State Government has spoken on the issue.
