Lawyer for  Ambode,  Olaniran Obele, was on Wednesday  barred from  entering the room where the joint committee of the state House of Assembly probing his client’s expenditure while in office was sitting. The committee however adjourned indefinitely following  a  Lagos State High Court’s ruling in the morning  ordering Ambode  and the lawmakers to maintain the “status quo” pending the hearing of the suit in which  the ex-governor  is seeking the Assembly to stop  probing him over the 820 mass transit buses purchased by his administration. Obele  said, “We came to represent Ambode but the officials of the  Assembly in a military manner prevented us from entering the committee room. “We brought processes from the court and letters to serve on the committee chairman and the Speaker but they refused to accept a validly issued court document containing what the court had said, but we were not allowed to go in. “The former governor respects the House, hence he sent his lawyer to inform the committee about  what transpired in court.” The  Chairman of the committee, Fatai Mojeed,  told reporters that  they decided to  stop  Obele because he was not the one invited. He said, “We invited the former governor, not his representative. We want him to come and clear himself, that was why  he was  not allowed in, and it is even against our business rule.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
