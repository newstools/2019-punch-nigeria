Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, has dissociated himself from the dilapidated state of LGEA Primary School, located at Ung-Pah, Lere Local Government Area. TrackaNG, a project by BudgIT which enables people to collaborate, track and give feedback on public projects in their communities, had flagged El-Rufai on Friday, based on a story published by the West Africa Reporters and titled, ‘Despite N25.4 Billion Education Allocation, Kaduna Primary School In Terrible Condition.’ The affected school is managed by the Local Government Education Authority, the online medium had reported. TrackNG hashtag its tweet with #FixPublicSchools. El-Rufai responded to the tweet immediately, explaining: “Dear @TrackaNG,  We appreciate your efforts. “Your message has been re-directed to the Chairman, Lere Local Government, who is responsible  for primary schools in the Constitution. “The state government assists with matching grants via SUBEB. “We neither control elected local government chairmen, nor touch their funds.” See photos of the school, courtesy, @TrackaNG:
