Tony Okafor An Onitsha-based lawyer, Jacob Obasi, was on Saturday reportedly beaten to a coma by officers of the Anambra State Police Command. The lawyer was rushed to a nearby hospital by passersby who rescued him from his assailants. It was gathered that the lawyer’s offence was his intervention in an attack on a citizen by the police in the area. The Nigerian Bar Association, Onitsha branch, described the police’s action as unprofessional and barbaric. In a statement by the Onitsha NBA chairman, Ozoemena Erinne, the lawyers said they had taken up the matter to ensure the policemen involved would not go unpunished. The statement read in part, “The branch was reliably informed that the only offence committed by O.J. Obasi Esq, was, as a concerned citizen, attempting to intervene when he saw a citizen being pummelled by some policemen in uniform, at Osuma bus stop, Awka Road, few meters away from his law firm.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Haruna Mohammed, expressed disappointment over the incident. He said, “The Commissioner of Police John Abang, is deeply worried about this disturbing development allegedly perpetrated by the policemen attached to the command. “The CP has equally directed discreet investigation to ascertain the authenticity of the development and if true, perpetrators of such professional misconduct will be brought to book.” Copyright PUNCH.
