Eniola Akinkuotu and Samson Folarin The Lagos State Police Command has invited a lecturer of European Languages at the University of Lagos, Dr. Boniface Igbeneghu, who is at the centre of the sex-for-grades scandal. In a letter of invitation sighted by The PUNCH on Friday, the lecturer, who was also a pastor at Foursquare Gospel Church, was asked to report at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Yaba, on October 23, 2019. In the letter, signed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of the SCIID, Yetunde Alonge, Igbeneghu was asked to report at D10 section. Alonge told Saturday PUNCH on Friday that the invitation was sent through the varsity management. She noted that the Police were awaiting a response, adding that the lecturer had yet to show up. “We are still waiting,” she said.

He was caught on video admitting to the existence of a “cold room” where male lecturers at UNILAG had sexual relations with female students in exchange for good grades. UNILAG and Foursquare have since suspended Igbeneghu pending outcomes of the investigations. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
