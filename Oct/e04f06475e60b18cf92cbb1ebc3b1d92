Raphael Ede, Enugu The Igbo Union in Benue State, comprising Igbo residents in various parts of Benue State, on Monday said their lives and property were no longer safe in Benue State despite government assurances. Speaking through its Public Relations Officer, Mr Emmanuel Ezeadi, to journalists in Enugu, the union said as at Monday, September 30, 2019, Igbo residents in Benue had lost three persons to kidnappers and paid a total of N277m as ransom to free 48 victims. While the union commended Governor Samuel Ortom for responding to the clarion call made earlier, it wanted him to do more to secure the lives and property of residents from criminals. Ezeadi explained that while the Benue State Government had initiated several measures to check the menace of kidnappers, local gangs and Fulani herdsmen in the state, the hoodlums had devised other means of terrorising the Igbo communities, including anonymous threat calls, unsolicited nocturnal visits by hooded local gangs demanding instant payment of “protection fees” at gun points.
