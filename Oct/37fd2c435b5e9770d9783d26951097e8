Leah Augustine, Kebbi The Comptroller General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ibrahim Ali (retd.), said the Nigeria Customs Service created the Kebbi State Area Command to improve revenue generation opportunities from the eight border stations in the state. The Comptroller General, who made the remark while speaking with reporters after his courtesy visit to Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State at the Government House, Birnin Kebbi, noted that the establishment of the Kebbi Area Command was a child of necessity. Ali, who was represented by his Deputy Comptroller General in charge of Finance, Administration and Technical Services, Abubakar Dangaladima, explained that Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara states were all under one area command in Sokoto before the split. He said, “Now, having considered Kebbi to have seven to eight border stations, we felt it is only right to have one in Kebbi; there is no need joining Kebbi with Sokoto and Zamfara states. We felt it is only right and justifiable to have an area command in Kebbi State.” Speaking on the closure of unregistered car dealers’ premises in the state, Ali said Kebbi State was not the only state affected by the action. He noted that the nationwide action was to ensure compliance with the Federal Government’s directives that all car dealers should register or have valid customs duties for their vehicles. According to him, the window is still open for dealers whose vehicles were confiscated to pay the necessary fines and recover their vehicles. Copyright PUNCH.
