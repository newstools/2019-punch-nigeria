Peter Dada, Akure Men of the Ondo State Police Command have arrested one Simeon Anyaegbu for alleged involvement in the killing of a Catholic priest, Rev. Fr. Godwin Ofonyelu, and his younger brother, Obikwelu Ofonyelu. The priest and his brother were allegedly murdered by the suspect and members of his gang on Owo-Ikare Expressway in 2015, while their vehicle was set ablaze in what was regarded as a robbery attack. But the family of the deceased said the act was an assassination. According to a source, Anyaegbu was apprehended in Port Harcourt, River State, on Tuesday, October 15, 2019 and brought to Akure by men of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. The family of the deceased, however, expressed worry over the delay in the prosecution of the suspect. The deceased’s father, Sir Christian Ofonyelu, urged the police to do justice by not wasting time in charging the suspect to court. Reacting, the Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Femi Joseph, who confirmed the arrest of the suspect, said the police would follow due process. “The suspect is with us and he will be charged to court at the appropriate time,” he added.
