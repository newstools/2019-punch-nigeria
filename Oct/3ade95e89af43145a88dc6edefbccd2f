Afeez Hanafi Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials has expressed support for the campaign on proper waste disposal by the government, stressing there is a need to educate the populace from the kindergarten to the university level on sanitation. Wife of the state Governor, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, who led other COWLSO members on a clean-up exercise, restated the commitment of the group in the continuous advocacy of cleaner environment initiative. A statement on Friday said the exercise was part of activities of the COWLSO’s 19th edition of the conference. She said, “Women are ready to support our husbands to ensure that the ideal Lagos is delivered. As it is the tradition of the conference to strategically empower women to contribute positively to the development of the State and Nigeria at large, this year’s theme was carefully selected in line with the vision and aspiration of the present administration to bring about greater Lagos of our dreams.” Copyright PUNCH.
