The Police in Niger have arrested three suspects for allegedly stealing female panties in Lapai and Gurara local government areas of the state. The Command’s spokesman, DSP Muhammadu Abubakar, told the News Agency of Nigeria in Minna on Friday that a complaint was lodged at the Lapai Police Division concerning the theft on October 18. He said the case was assigned for investigation, which resulted in the arrest of a 24-year-old man, Mohammed Ali, a resident of state low cost housing estate, in whose possession the pants were found. Abubakar said when quizzed by the Police, Ali confessed to have broken into the house of the complainant through the window and removed the panties from where they were spread. Further investigation revealed that the suspect also stole three other panties from different rooms in the same neighbourhood. The suspect said he delivered the stolen panties to one Malam Madaji Yabajeko of Agaie Local Government Area, now at large. Abubakar said the case would soon be charged to court after completion of Police investigation. Similarly, on October 9, acting on another report, operatives of Kaffin-Koro Division arrested one Abubakar Sadiq, 18; and Ephraim Isaiah, 19, both students of Izom Science Secondary School, Gurara Local Government Area, for stealing female panties. Abubakar said the two suspects had since been charged to court. (NAN)
