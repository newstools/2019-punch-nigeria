Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo The Caretaker Chairman of Donga Local Government Council in Taraba State, Nashuka Ipeyen, on Tuesday narrowly escaped assassination while holding a meeting with stakeholders in the council. Ipeyen was said to have been attacked by a group protesting against his collaboration with the security agencies, leading to the arrest of some of their members in the area. Ipeyen said the protesters attacked the local government lodge while they were meeting to discuss how to resolve the crisis between Jukun and Tiv in the council. He said the soldiers and riot police posted to the area to ensure peace saved his life. According to him, the lives of other people at the meeting were also threatened. The council chief said his house was vandalised and looted by the protesters after they failed in their attempt to lynch him. Ipeyen said, “The militias attacked me after accusing me of supporting the military and other people. I was however rescued alongside others. “I’m now in the middle of a crisis; the Tiv are accusing me of supporting my Jukun people; my Jukun people are accusing me of supporting the security agencies. “But all I want is for the crisis to stop. We don’t need  any crisis; what we need is peace.” Spokesman for the police in the state, DSP David Misal, said the state command had yet to be briefed on the incident. Copyright PUNCH.
