Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The General Manager of the Norgem Nigeria Limited, Ayorinde Arogbodo, has advised Nigerians to eat egg to lower the risk of heart diseases, breast cancer, cataracts and macular degeneration of the eye. Arogbodo, in a statement on Sunday, noted that egg is a source of protein, amino acid, calcium, sodium, iodine, selenium, choline and vitamins A, B, D and E, describing it as a mineral cocktail for a healthy diet. He said, “Eggs help protect against heart disease, vital for nerves and muscles to function correctly, lower the risk of heart disease, prevent age-related memory loss and reduce the risk of breast cancer by as much as 40 per cent.  Eggs really are a large vitamin pill in 100 per cent natural packaging and an egg a day is ok. “It is for this reason that the Poultry Association of Nigeria in different states around the country is committed to celebrating the World Egg Day with the support of organisations like Norgem Nigeria Limited and ultimately correct the sometimes imperfect perception of the egg that the Nigerian populace may possess.” Copyright PUNCH.
