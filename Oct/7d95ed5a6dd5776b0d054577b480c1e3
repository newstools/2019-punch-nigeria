Enyioha Opara, Minna One Ibrahim Mohammed, a resident of Maikunkele in the Bosso Local Government Area of Niger State, has been arrested by the police for allegedly beating his nine-year-old son to death. The suspect was arrested by a team of policemen attached to the Paiko Division following a report by one Abubakar Adamu of Yidna village in Paiko. Northern City News gathered in Minna on Tuesday that the deceased, who was rearing cattle for his father, was allegedly beaten to death for mischief. It was learnt that the suspect flogged his son with a cane until he died from the continuous beating. In an interview with our correspondent, Mohammed who was full of regrets over the incident, said he had no intention of killing his son, adding that he was only trying to correct him when tragedy struck. “My son had not been honest with me on issues; I got angry with him and lost my temper when I was beating him. Unfortunately, he died. I am really sorry for what I did,” he stated. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Muhammad Abubakar, who confirmed the incident, said the suspect had been charged.
