Doctors at Cedarcrest Hospital, in Apo District of Abuja, have successfully operated on a 13-month-old baby, Michael Duniya, who was viciously attacked by a pit bull at Mambilla Barracks, Abuja, on Tuesday, October 8. Cedarcrest Hospitals was where Yusuf, son of President Muhammadu Buhari, was first treated following his accident on a power bike in December 2017. Our Correspondent reports that the black dog, believed to be a pit bull, reportedly broke free from its cage and wandered off into the block where little Michael was playing with his four-year-old brother. Upon seeing the dog, his older brother immediately fled into the house, but Michael was not quick enough as the dog pounced on him.

A neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said she quickly raised the alarm. The dog had to be killed before the baby could be rescued from its deadly grip, our Correspondent reported.
