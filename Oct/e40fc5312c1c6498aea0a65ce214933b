Hackers have shut down the cyber network of Johannesburg City Council, targeting computers of Local Government employees in South Africa’s economic hub, city officials on Friday said. The hackers allegedly demanded ransom in the form of bitcoins in exchange for reactivating internet and email links to the city’s billing systems, local media reported. The City of Johannesburg said it could not confirm the authenticity of the ransom demand and that it’s forensic and IT units were investigating the attack. Johannesburg is home to five million residents and contributes 16 per cent to the country’s total 326 billion dollars national economy. Officials said the attack on Thursday afternoon via employees’ computers had affected its call centres, website and online electronic platforms. “You’re sitting as an employee and then boom, a message appears on your computer screen and it turns blue. You try to reboot, switch off and nothing.

United Kingdom-based tech firm Mimecast said in a report there was 19 per cent increase in ransomware attacks targeting South African companies between 2018 and 2019. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim’s files, with the hacker typically demanding payment to restore access. (Reuters/NAN)
