MAIHARAJI ALTINE Any court judge who allows the Quran to be desecrated on their court premises will be dismissed immediately. The Grand Kadi, Zamfara State Shari’a Court of Appeal, Dr Dahiru Gusau, has said. Gusau stated this in a statement on Saturday signed by the spokesperson for the Shari’a Court of Appeal, Babangida Idris. Following the recent discovery of some Qurans dumped in the toilet of one of the primary schools in the state, Gusau said he would be left with no option but to dismiss any judge who allowed such to happen in their court. “Any Shari’a court judge, registrar or any ranking officer who allows the desecration of the Holy Quran on their court premises shall be severely dealt with,” he said. The Grand Kadi called on the perpetrators of the evil act to desist from doing so to avoid incurring the wrath of the law. Copyright PUNCH.
