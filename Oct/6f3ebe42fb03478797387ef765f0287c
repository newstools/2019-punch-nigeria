Peter Dada, Akure The Ayetoro community in the Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State, on Sunday, said Oba Olorunmbe Ojagbohunmi, who was recently released from a correctional facility, was never a monarch in the town. Ojagbohunmi was arrested by the state police command in January for involvement in conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace in the coastal community and was remanded in the correctional facility by a court. The community declared that the real traditional ruler of the town is Oba Micah Ajijo, who according to it, never had any court case nor remanded in a correctional facility. In a statement issued on behalf of the elders of the community by the Principal Secretary of the Ayetoro community, Chief Dele Kudehinbu, the community said Ojagbohunmi was dragged before the court for breaching the peace of the land by parading himself as the traditional ruler of the town and was remanded since January. The statement said the self-acclaimed monarch was released on bail following the intervention of eminent people in the area, particularly the Olugbo of Ugbo, Oba Obateru Akinruntan, and given some conditions.
