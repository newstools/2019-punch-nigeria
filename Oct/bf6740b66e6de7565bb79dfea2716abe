According to him, N78.3 billion will be spent on capital expenditure, translating to 57 per cent of the budget, while N58.69 billion or 43 per cent is for recurrent expenditure. Presenting the budget breakdown, Okoye said that the state government had put automated reforms in place to capture more residents into the tax net. “From an Internally Generated Revenue standpoint, we are projecting N30 billion for 2020 which will be N2.5 billion every month. “As we speak today, we have about 300, 000 taxpayers registered in the state, and we also have about 10,000 businesses registered in Anambra. “I can tell you that of all these numbers, less than 10 per cent are paying taxes and most of them are also paying understated taxes. “If we can increase that figure to 20 per cent, that will take our current IGR rate from N 1.7 billion to N3.4 billion, that doubles it. “This is why government instituted comprehensive reforms in the state to capture many residents and businesses. “We have the Anambra State Social Service Identity number and other automation drives across the state to get data, and also capture many residents into the tax net,’’ he said. Okoye said that government needed the taxpayers’ money to drive development in the state. (NAN)
