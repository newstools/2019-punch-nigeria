John Charles, Makurdi The governorship election petitions tribunal will today (Monday) give judgment on the case between the governorship candidate for the All Progressives Congress, Emmanuel Jime, and Governor Samuel Ortom of the Peoples Democratic Party. The governorship candidate for the APC had challenged Ortom’s victory as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission. Jime had prayed the tribunal  to nullify the reelection  of Ortom  on the grounds  that the election  was marred with irregularities. Recall that counsel for both parties had about a month ago adopted their written addresses. The Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Henry Olusiyi, reserved  judgement, saying  a date would  be  communicated to both parties. Speaking at the PDP caucus meeting held at the party secretariat, the governor told his supporters that he relied on God for victory in today’s judgment. He said, “The opposition party vowed to use federal might during the governorship election in March but we won with a wide margin. “My belief in God has not shaken, we will be victorious.” Copyright PUNCH.
