A 12-year-old boy has allegedly confessed to the killing of a nine-year-old autistic girl in Brazil. The deceased, Raissa Caparelli, was said to have attended a local charity event with her family member at the Unified Educational Centre in Anhanguera, a suburb of São Paulo before she went missing. Her body was discovered roughly two-and-a-half miles away from the festival, bound with a rope to a tree in the city’s municipal park. Security cameras outside Anhanguera Park caught the last moments of the child, who was wearing a pink outfit, crossing a road and walking hand in hand with the accused around 12:30 pm. According to Dailymail, the 12-year-old suspect claimed he was ‘just walking’ with the victim. He claimed they were friends who lived on the same street, played together and studied at the same school. Cops revealed that the boy’s mother took him to the police station on Monday after he later confessed to committing the crime in front of relatives. Rosevânia, the mother of the girl said she took her daughter and her younger son to the party at CEU around 12 noon on Sunday. At one point, the mother left the girl queuing with the boy for a turn on a trampoline while she went to get popcorn with her son. When she returned, her daughter had disappeared. A hunt was immediately launched by festival organisers and concerned visitors. Police chief Marturano said he is awaiting a psychological report on the youngster who has apparently refused to give a motive for the crime. ‘Our investigations also continue with the intention of identifying other potential perpetrators of the crime. However, there are many contradictions and inconsistencies in the boy’s statement.’
