Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Sector Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps, on Monday, said one person lost his life in a road crash that occurred on Sunday at Iyere in the Owo Local Government Area of the state. The accident involved a Honda Accord car with number plate WWW 331 MW and a mini bus with number plate WEN 54 AA. It was gathered that the vehicles had a head-on collision, which led to several hours of gridlock until men of the FRSC, Owo unit, came to clear the road. The identity of the deceased had yet to be ascertained as of the time of filing this report, but the FRSC said he was a young boy. The Head of Operations, FRSC in the state, Mr Olusegun Ogungbemide, said the accident was due to excessive speed and disobedience of traffic rules and regulations on the part of the drivers of both vehicles. “The accident claimed one life, a small boy; while two people, a male and a female adult, were injured. We took the victims to the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, while the remains of the deceased were taken away by his family,” he stated. Copyright PUNCH.
