Ademola Babalola, Ibadan The recently kidnapped Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics, College of Agriculture, Igbo Ora branch, Olujide Opadijo, on Thursday, alleged renewed kidnapping activities in the area and called on the Oyo State Government to come to the aid of the community. Opadijo was kidnapped alongside four other union leaders about three weeks ago while returning from a meeting in Oke Ogun area of the state. He was later set free after allegedly paying N5m ransom to the kidnappers, some of who he identified as Fulani. In a conversation with The PUNCH correspondent on Thursday, Opadijo relayed how Fulani stormed the residence of an auditor of OYSCAI and threatened the wife with abduction unless she provided them enough money. Reminded that the incident could be a case of robbery, Opadijo said, “No. Reason is they earlier threatened to kidnap her and the kids. Besides, another resident was attacked in his house by the same group of Fulani and he narrowly escaped being whisked away but they inflicted machete cuts on him and is presently admitted at a private clinic in Igbo Ora,” he added. While stressing that his people were no longer safe in the school and at homes, Opadijo disclosed that “comrades are eagerly agitating for a mass protest to pass vote of no confidence in security agencies. “Imagine the matter was reported to the police around 2pm and they didn’t show up until 8pm! We are being surrounded by the Fulani and it will get to a stage they will ask everybody to surrender. “Igboora and indeed entire Ibarapaland is under siege of Fulani.
