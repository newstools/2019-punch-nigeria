Peter Dada, Akure Two kids of different parents, identified as Igulapelewe Inuesokan and Justinah Seiwei have been declared missing in Ajakpa community of Ese Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State. It was gathered that the children had been missing since last Friday during the flood that occurred in the community. They were said to be missing when their parents were not at home. It was when the parents returned that the two children were discovered missing. Sequel to this, it was suspected that the kids must have been swept away by the flood. A traditional ruler in the community, High Chief Godwin Akpos, who disclosed this on the telephone, said the incident was caused by the flood which had wreaked havoc in the town. He said, “It has never happened like this before. The situation has badly affected the whole community, no house was spared, including schools and churches. “It (the flood) started about four days ago but today (Sunday) is the worst. “All our houses and property are gone. It was so unfortunate that we even lost two children to the incident.” When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer of the state command, Mr. Femi Joseph, said he had not been briefed about the matter.
