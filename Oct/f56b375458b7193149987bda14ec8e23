While handing over the items and the suspects to the Nigeria Customs Service, the Commander of NNS Victory Navy Commodore Vincent Okeke said, “These items were seized on  October  26 offshore Ibaka while the vessel was transporting  them  from Cameroon to Akwa Ibom State. The wooden boat was arrested by our men and brought to the base. On getting to the base we recovered 1,221 bags of foreign parboiled rice. “We have arrested 87 suspects and made several seizures in the past, about 18 of them, since January. Based on the confessions of the latest suspects, we knew they were heading  for Akwa Ibom State. They even gave us the name of the owner of the goods and we have gone after him. “This particular arrest is worth about N34m.” A Chief Superintendent of Customs, Sanusi Barade, who is also in charge of Border Drill comprising all security agencies, received the items and the suspects.
