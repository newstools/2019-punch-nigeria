Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia A mother and her baby, on Wednesday,Â  narrowly escaped death following the earth tremor that destroyed their residence in Umuchime, Amuzukwu Ibeku, in the Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State. The woman, Mrs Ijeoma Emmanuel, said the house caved in after the tremor that shook the entire area. Ijeoma stated that she noticed cracks on the walls of her room and later experienced the ground shifting around noon and immediately carried her baby and ran out, after which the building crumbled. She thanked God for saving her and her baby. The Director of Information, Government House, Umuahia, Mr Jinanwa Azubuike, who is a next-door neighbour to Ijeoma, said his house was now precariously sitting on the edge of the over 20-metre deep gully created by the tremor. He lamented that the land and buildings in the area were caving in, while the residents now live in fear. Azubuike stated that the residents drew the attention of the Federal Government to their plight two years ago when the problem was first noticed. According to him, the issue is beyond what an individual can handle. He pleaded with the government to come to the aid of the inhabitants of the area. Copyright PUNCH.
