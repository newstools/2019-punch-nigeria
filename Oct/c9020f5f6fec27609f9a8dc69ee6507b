Policemen have arrested four fleeing suspected drug barons who had saved them from drowning. The policemen were chasing the drug lords on the dark blue waters off southern Spain, but the Police boat had collided with that of the suspects, sending three of the policemen tumbling into the dangerous waters. “The police were piloting a narrow boat, and their prey was an even smaller vessel,” the New York Times reported, quoting a statement by the Spanish Police, the Guardia Civil. “A helicopter of the Málaga Aerial Unit, supporting the Police, caught some of the chase on camera. “The video shows the Police boat trying to intercept its target on an angle, moving so fast that it bounced across the waves. “Then the boats collided, and the three officers tumbled into the sea. “Their boat kept spinning out of control, its engine blades still churning through the waves as the officers tried to swim away,” the medium added. The ‘benevolent’ suspects yielded to a plea coming from the Police helicopter hovering overhead, asking them to save the three policemen who were doing their best to survive the odds. The suspects saved the policemen, who promptly arrested them and took them into custody.
