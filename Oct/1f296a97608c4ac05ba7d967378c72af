A German court on Thursday sentenced an 80-year-old man to seven-year imprisonment for a series of bank robberies over a decade. The bank staff targeted by the man had endured considerable psychological suffering, presiding Judge, Hannes Breucker, said in Hechingen, south-west Germany. The man admitted to targeting a number of banks over the years between 2009 and 2019, using the same method. He entered the bank, carrying a fake bomb and handed over a letter demanding for money. He was said to have been successful on three occasions. (dpa/NAN)
