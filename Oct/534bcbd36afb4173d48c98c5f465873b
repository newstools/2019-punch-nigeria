German Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas continues his North African tour on Monday with a stop in Tunis, where he plans to meet new Tunisian President Kais Saied. The former law professor won the presidential run-off on October 13 by a landslide and was sworn in less than a week ago. The 61-year-old conservative succeeds Beji Caid Essebsi, who died in July. Speaking in Tunis, Maas said that Germany was ready to continue to take part in the fight against the Islamic State terrorist militia following the death of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

He added that the impact of al-Baghdadi’s death on the structure of Islamic State needed to be observed. “I’m sure that it will be expected of Germany and rightly expected that we take part in the fight against Islamic State, and we take responsibility for that.’’ Germany military participation was extended last week by parliament. The engagement of German reconnaissance and tanker planes was only extended until March 31, however. German army instructors are involved in Iraq in the anti-Islamic State coalition, to which around 80 nations belong. A meeting is scheduled for November to determine how the coalition proceeds. According to the US-led coalition, between 14,000 to 18,000 Islamic State supporters remain in the regions of Iraq and Syria formerly controlled by the extremist group. (dpa/NAN)
