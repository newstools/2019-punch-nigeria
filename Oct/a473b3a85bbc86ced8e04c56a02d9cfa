Akinpelu Dada A 30-year-old man, Solomon Oguneletu, has been arrested by men of the Ogun State Police Command for allegedly defiling his 12-year-old daughter. The suspect’s arrest followed a report by one Alhaji Semiu Obamuyiwa at the Imeko Divisional headquarters that the victim, a primary school pupil, confided in one of her teachers that her father had been having carnal knowledge of her since 2018 with a threat to kill her if she divulged the affairs to anyone.

He stated, “On interrogation, the suspect, who is a driver, confessed to the crime.

The victim has been taken to a general hospital for medical care. “Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama, has ordered the transfer of the suspect to the Anti-human Trafficking and Child Labour Unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for further investigation and prosecution.” Copyright PUNCH.
