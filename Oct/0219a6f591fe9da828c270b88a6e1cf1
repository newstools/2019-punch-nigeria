Former Vice President Namadi Sambo has described as “total falsehood and fallacy’’ a story linking him to the ownership of Kaduna Electric Power Distribution Company of Nigeria. Sambo stated this in a release he signed on Friday in Kaduna. He said his attention had been drawn to an online publication on a query issued by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to Power Distribution Companies. “The story alleged that I own KAEDCO through a proxy. “I wish to state unequivocally that the story is totally untrue, malicious and unfounded. “The story is aimed at bringing my reputation to disrepute. “For the records, I do not own a single share in the company or any of the public privatised companies under my watch, either directly or through a proxy,’’ he said. Sambo added:”As the chairman of the Privatisation Council and indeed as public servant, I discharged my duties responsibly in accordance with laid down rules and procedures and in the interest of the nation.” (NAN)
