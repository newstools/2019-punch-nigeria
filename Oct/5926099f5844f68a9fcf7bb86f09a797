Tony Okafor, Awka The Okpalaku family in Achina, Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State, has alleged that the police in the state are causing great pains to their 98-year-old mother, Cecilia Okpalaku. In a petition to the state Commissioner of Police, the family alleged that since the woman was harassed and injured by some personnel of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, she had been subjected to both physical and psychological pains. Southern City News had reported that the nonagenarian was in August molested and injured by SARS officials in a bid to forcefully gain entrance into her home to arrest her son, Emeka, who had a misunderstanding with his wife, Esther. Esther had reportedly stormed her husband’s house in Achina with some SARS personnel, who allegedly assaulted madamCecilia, who tried to stop them from entering the house. But in a petition made available to journalists on Tuesday in Awka, the family accused the SARS of illegally invading their home, attacking and inflicting serious injuries on their mother. The petitioner, Nathaniel Okpalaku, further accused the police of prevarication in prosecuting the matter. The petition read in part, “Since the matter was moved to the state’s Special Investigation Bureau, a police department in charge of investigation, no progress has been made due to the reluctance of the SARS to cooperate with the bureau. “The action of the SARS calls for proper investigation of its interest in the case and also suggests that it has taken sides. “We have vowed to pursue this matter until justice prevails over the illegal transfer of aggression and consequent hospitalisation of our aged mother, Mrs Cecilia Okpalaku, by the SARS.” Copyright PUNCH.
