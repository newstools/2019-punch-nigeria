Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi A renowned armed robber hunter in Bauchi State, Ali Kwarra, has narrated how 26 officers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and six military officers were arrested for allegedly selling arms and ammunitions to kidnappers and bandits in Zamfara and Katsina states. He told newsmen in an interview that the feat was made possible through the joint operation with the military as directed by President Muhammadu Buhari to track down bandits and kidnappers in Katsina and Zamfara states. He added that the NSCDS was also instrumental in arresting the suspects, including some of its men. Kwarra stated that the sale of arms and ammunition was exposed by a repentant armed robber, who disclosed that some security officers were involved in the shady deal, pointing out that he had an interaction with the repentant armed robber, who gave him the full information on how the deal was carried out. He said, “I then asked him if he could link me with the officers involved and he willingly agreed to connect me with one Fulani man, who was part of the negotiations with the military and the NSCDC officers, for the purchase of N300,000 worth of ammunition from the gang leader. “The repentant robber told me that they purchased another N400,000 worth of ammunition and within the same week, they purchased another set worth N1.5m from him. “On the fourth encounter, in collaboration with the military, we arrested the gang leader, who exposed five NSCDC personnel and we arrested 21 officers of the corps and six military officers.” Copyright PUNCH.
