Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The founder of the Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, Chief Afe Babalola, on Saturday blamed the dwindling produce in the farms on the widening gap between local farmers and funding organisations. Babalola said the gap needed to be bridged for farmers to be able to access funds to boost food production and contribute largely to bailing Nigeria out of the present national economic crisis. The ABUAD founder, who spoke at the grand finale of the three-day 2019 Afe Babalola Agricultural Expo where he doled out N5.8m to 48 best performing local farmers in Ekiti State to improve their farm exploits, said, “The annual event was conceived to bridge this widening gap. “The annual distribution of the cash gift to farmers, which began since 2012, is my deliberate design to complement government’s efforts at revamping agriculture and as well make farming more attractive to young persons and increase tempo of food production.” The ABUAD founder, who is also a farmer, said he derived pleasure in building people’s capacity and making them fulfil their dreams, adding that he would to continue to contribute his quota to the growth and development of the country in every way humanly possible. As the cash gifts ranging from N150,000 to N100,000 were handed over to the best farmer, second best, and third best in each of the 16 local government areas of the state, Babalola enjoined beneficiaries not to divert the money to other uses but to justify the reason for the money.
