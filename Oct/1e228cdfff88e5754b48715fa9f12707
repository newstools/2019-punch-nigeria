Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has commiserated with the leadership of the Nigeria Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs over the passing of the Deputy President-General of the council, Alhaji Sakariyahu Babalola, last Wednesday in Lagos. Babalola, Chairman of Telemobile Nigeria Limited, was also the President, Muslim Ummah of South-West of Nigeria and Saraki Adinni of Lagos Central Mosque until his death. According to a statement by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, on Sunday, Fayemi described the late Babalola as a successful entrepreneur, who got to the top by dint of hard work. “Alhaji Babalola would be remembered for his exemplary lifestyle . He was a man who demonstrated great commitment to the service of Allah as reflected in the various leadership roles he played in the promotion of Islamic religion,” the governor said. Fayemi also commiserated with the family of the late Senator Mojisoluwa Akinfenwa and the progressives family in the country on the death of the Afenifere chieftain and former Alliance for Democracy leader in the National Assembly. The governor described the late Senator as a decent and diligent politician, saying his death was a major loss to the family of the progressives in the country. “We shall miss Baba’s frankness and wise counsel. He was consistent, principled and decent. Our prayer is that God will grant him eternal rest and grant the family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
