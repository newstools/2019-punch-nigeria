British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday he would give parliament more time to scrutinise his Brexit plan if it agrees to hold a snap general election on December 12. He said if MPs really wanted more time to study his deal, “they can have it, but they have to agree on a general election on December 12”, Johnson said in televised remarks. (AFP)
