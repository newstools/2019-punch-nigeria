ADEMOLA BABALOLA Oyo State Government has reiterated its resolve to use agricultural to empower citizens and banish hunger, saying there is hunger in the country. The state Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Ojemuyiwa Ojekunle, made the assertion during the annual celebration of World Food Day held by the state Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Ojekunle disclosed that in order to ensure food security, alleviate poverty and create job employment in the state, the government has put all machinery in place for several innovative programs, such as capacity building, empowerment, rehabilitation of rural roads and creation of access to credit facilities. He said, “There is no need to repeat the fact that hunger is reigning, especially among the common people. Overtime we have seen figures of people under the poverty net but the present administration in the state came in with the resolve to banish poverty and hunger through the use of commercial agriculture. “You must have seen the strides since the administration started. All efforts have been geared towards securing lives and property of our people, creating an enabling environment for small-scale businesses as well as big time investors to thrive.” He stated further that the plan of the present administration was to turn Oyo State into a leading commercial hub through agricultural revolution.
