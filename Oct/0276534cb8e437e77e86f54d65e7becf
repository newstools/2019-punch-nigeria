Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta A 39-year-old man, Olakunle Agbaje, has been arrested by men of the Ogun State Police Command for allegedly stealing a month-old baby from his sleeping mother. Agbaje, a resident of No. 13 Dennis Street, Arigbawonwo area of Mowe in the Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of the state, was alleged to have sneaked into Taiwo Marufu’s apartment at No. 32 Odukoya Street, Adesan, Mowe, and allegedly stole the baby while the mother was asleep. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the suspect’s arrest in a statement on Monday. Oyeyemi said Agbaje was arrested on Saturday following a distress call received by the police at the Mowe Division headquarters that a woman, Taiwo Marufu, was sleeping in her room at the Adesan area of Mowe when the suspect sneaked into her room and took the baby boy from her side. The PPRO stated, “While the suspect was trying to tiptoe out of the room, the mother of the child woke up and raised the alarm, consequent upon which a distress call was made to the police. “On receiving the information, the DPO Mowe Division, Marvis Jayeola, quickly moved to the scene with his men and the suspect was promptly arrested.
