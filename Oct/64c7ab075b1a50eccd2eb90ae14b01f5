Sola Shittu, Benin Property worth millions of naira were on Saturday night gutted by fire at Santana Market located at Benin-Sapele road, Benin city. Details of the cause of the fire incident were still sketchy as of the time of filing this report but an eyewitness said the fire outbreak might not be unconnected to a power surge which resulted in an explosion in one of the stalls. By Sunday morning,Â  a huge number of sympathisers had gathered at the market as victims count their loses. A woman was seen rolling on the ground weeping as people around tried to console her. Details soon.
