Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Police have buried the three robbery suspects who were burnt to death by a mob at Dutsen Alhaji, a suburb of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The three suspects were burnt to death on Monday. Our Correspondent learnt that the Force took the decision to bury the charred corpses of the men because it would be hard to identify them, as they were burnt beyond recognition. They were burnt alongside their operational car. The suspects were lynched after they allegedly robbed and threw out a lady from their vehicle. The FCT Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Mr. Ayuba Wobin, confirmed on Tuesday that the robbery suspects were interred on Monday.
