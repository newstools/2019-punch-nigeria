Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The National Identity Management Commission has insisted on N5,000 for the renewal of the national identity card. According to the commission, the card has more embedded features than the passport and the Automated Teller Machine card. The Director General/Chief Executive Officer, NIMC, Mr Aliyu Aziz, stated this in Abuja on Wednesday when he appeared before the House of Representatives’ Committee on Diaspora Affairs. The NIMC had on October 15, 2019, said the renewal of the national identity card would cost N5,000 payable through Remita, a Federal Government revenue collection platform. The announcement via its Twitter handle, @nimc_ng, had generated public criticisms. The NIMC boss, however, explained that while the card was to be issued to Nigerians and non-Nigerian residents for free, there was prior announcement that it could be reissued or renewed for free. The NIMC boss was asked why the commission had been issuing paper slips while the collection of the card was being delayed for years. The lawmakers also asked why Nigerians in the diaspora were being asked to pay $50 to obtain the card, even when the official cost is $47. Aziz said, “I want to also make it very clear that in NIMC linguistics, we don’t have any temporary or permanent card. It is the language used by the Independent National Electoral Commission (for Permanent Voter Card) and for driving licence (by the Federal Road Safety Corps).” Copyright PUNCH.
