The information was conveyed by Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State, while briefing State House correspondents after the NEC meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Tuesday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He said that the major highlights were updates on disease control efforts by the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire. He added that “Nigeria is steadily progressing toward polio certification by June 2020. Despite the progress, there is still work to be done to sustain the current polio gains and stop the transmission of the circulating vaccine-derived polio virus.

He added that the minister also appealed that the taskforce is chaired by deputy governors in states. (NAN)
