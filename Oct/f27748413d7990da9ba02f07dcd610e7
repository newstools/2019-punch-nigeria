A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Kano State on Friday ordered that a 22-year-old student, Nu’uman Abubakar, who allegedly killed a 17-year-old boy, be remanded in a correctional centre. Abubakar, a student at the Kano State University of Technology, Wudil, is charged with culpable homicide, the News Agency of Nigeria reports. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Muhammad Idris, adjourned the matter until October 28, 2019 for mention. The Prosecution Counsel, ASP Badamasi Gawuna, told the court that the complainant, Abdulrahman Haladu, residing in Jan Dutse Village, Wudil Local Government Area, reported the matter at Wudil Police Station on August 1. Gawuna alleged that the complainant told the police that the defendant hit his son with a club during a misunderstanding. He said that the victim was taken to the Wudil General Hospital for treatment, where he was confirmed dead. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.
