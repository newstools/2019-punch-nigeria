Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt RIVERS State Governor, Nyesom Wike, said he had asked the authorities of Port Harcourt Polo Club located in the state capital to issue quit notice to those dwelling in shanties illegally near the facility. Wike stated that he would invite the management of Polo Club to work towards removing the shanties, which he added, were defacing the area. The governor, who spoke on Monday after inspecting ongoing projects in the state, cautioned that the government would be compelled to take tough actions should the Polo Club management fail to act. “We cannot allow the kind of shanties that I am seeing here. I have sent for the President of Port Harcourt Polo Club to come and give them notice to quit,” he said. Wike pointed out that the ongoing urban renewal of Port Harcourt City and adjoining towns of the state capital was aimed at returning the city to its Garden City status. He expressed his administration’s commitment to reconstructing key roads in the state capital to ease traffic congestion and boost the economy of the state. The governor stated that 70 percent of the urban renewal scheme would be handled by a Nigerian-based international construction company. “We are working hard to return Port Harcourt City to its Garden City status. That is why we have embarked on massive urban renewal projects across the state capital. “Seventy percent of the roads under construction will be handled by an international construction company, Julius Berger. We are committed to delivering roads that will last for the people of the state,” he said. Wike added that the judges’ quarters had already been completed, while contractors were concluding work on the external services, especially the drainage system. Disclosing that the Mother and Child Hospital will be completed by the end of the year, he commended the quality of work done by the contractors.
