Ademola Babalola, Ibadan An Oyo State High Court presided over by Justice Bayo Taiwo, on Wednesday, sentenced one Wright John to one year’s imprisonment for defrauding an American, Erica Hegge, of $1,450. The 29-year-old John, who operated under the pseudonym, David Riger, was found guilty of one count of obtaining money by false pretences filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibadan zonal office. The offence, according to the agency, runs contrary to Section 419 of the Criminal Code, Cap 38, Laws of Oyo State, 2000. The convict pleaded guilty to the charge as part of a plea bargain agreement with the commission. While relating with his victim, John had falsely presented himself as a white man and subsequently preyed on her. The EFCC counsel, Abdulrasheed Suleman, prayed the court to adopt the terms of the plea bargain agreement, including restitution of the sum to the owner and forfeiture of the items recovered from the convict. Justice Taiwo granted the prayers and ordered that the convict should pay back the sum of $1,450 to the owner through the EFCC. He also ordered that a Tecno phone recovered from him  be forfeited to the Federal Government. Copyright PUNCH.
