An 8-year-old boy and his 5-year-old brother crashed their parents’ car in the north-western German city of Hagen after driving it for only a few metres, police said on Tuesday. No one was injured in the incident late Monday, but the vehicle was so badly damaged that it had to be towed, according to police. Witnesses had called the police to the site of the accident around 11:30 pm (2130 GMT). According to the police, the 8-year-old boy was sitting at the wheel and the 5-year-old in the passenger seat.
