The Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, has appealed to wealthy Nigerians to assist the nation’s universities with funds to enable them to maximise their intake capacities. The Vice-Chancellor (VC), Prof. Kolawole Salako, made the appeal on Saturday at a press conference in Abeokuta against the backdrop of the post-UTME screening recently conducted by the institution. Salako said that except universities were endowed with the much-needed funds, they would continue to shut their gates against many Nigerian youths eligible for admission.

According him, many wealthy Nigerians would rather heap blame on the government which also needed their support to improve the nation’s education sector. “Don’t tell me to advise government; tell me to advise Nigerians. Bill Gate is not a Nigerian but he is sponsoring education, agriculture, and health in Nigeria. “My advice to wealthy Nigerians is that they should understand that all those billions of naira they have should be used to assist humanity for enduring legacies. “What our wealthy men and women should do is what their counterparts are doing in the US and Europe where wealthy people go into serious endowment. “One family with only one daughter donated billions of dollar to Harvard University and Stanford University.
