HINDI LIVINUS Six herders grazing their cattle at Gurin, Fufore Local Government Area of Adamawa State were on Saturday abducted by armed bandits. An eyewitness told Sunday PUNCH that the bandits, who invaded the community, abducted the herders some four kilometres away from the Fufore-Gurin Highway. One of the victims was, however, set free by the gunmen to inform others’ relatives of the abduction. The Adamawa State Police Command confirmed the incident. However, the police spokesperson DSP Suleiman Nguroje said four herdsmen were kidnapped. “The information reaching us is that four persons were kidnapped, but the bandits freed one of them to inform relatives of the others. The victims were kidnapped some four kilometres away from the Fufore-Gurin Road in the early hours of Saturday. “They were grazing their cattle when the kidnappers whisked them away and left their cattle wandering around,” Nguroje said. Kidnapping for ransom has raised concerns among residents, though recently, the police, in collaboration with local vigilantes and leaders of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, arrested some kidnap kingpins terrorising the state. Some police collaborators have been murdered in recent times, including a local vigilante leader, Abdul Bali, and another leader of the MACBAN, Tabital Pulaaku Jam. Copyright PUNCH.
