Israeli embassies and consulates around the world closed down on Wednesday as diplomats and military attachés went on strike over a dispute with the Finance Ministry. The dispute is said to be over expense stipends paid to envoys, reports Times of Isreal. It was reported that the strike, coordinated by the Foreign Ministry, the Defence Ministry and the Histadrut Labor Federation, came after the Treasury reportedly backtracked on previous understandings and said it would force the envoys to pay back thousands of dollars that they had been reimbursed for expenses.
