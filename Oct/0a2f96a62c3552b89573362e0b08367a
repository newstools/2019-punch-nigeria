Samson Folarin Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has said the flooding in Isheri-North, a border area on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, is beyond the state government. A statement on Wednesday by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Kunle Somorin, stated that the governor spoke while receiving a four-man team of the Africa Finance Corporation in Abeokuta, the state capital. According to the statement, Abiodun welcomed the plan of the corporation to partner the government in the reconstruction of Attan-Lusada-Agbara Road. “I stopped by at Isheri where we have a lot of estates and the state of road infrastructure is deplorable. Currently, the place is totally flooded and the entire estates have been submerged. “I told the flood victims that this place required us to declare a state of emergency and we are actually going to do that because the problem is beyond the state,” he said. The governor explained that his government had since realised that the biggest issue for residents was the state of infrastructure, especially the state ecology and bad road network. “The area is mixed with industries and residential estates. There is a lot of development going on there and people have abandoned their houses; beautiful houses. This is because the roads are non-existing, there are no drainage channels, houses are built on flood plains, so we need help,” he added. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
