Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo An Osun State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Osogbo, on Wednesday, stopped an attempt by the father of a rape victim from withdrawing from the case against the accused persons. The accused, Adebayo Ayanwale, 21, and Segun Adeleke, 27, allegedly defiled the 16-year-old victim. According to the details of the charges, Ayanwale and Adeleke allegedly defiled and indecently assaulted the victim on March 13, 2019, at No.1 Ade Festus Street, Jaleyemi area of Osogbo. The accused were first arraigned on March 29, 2019, and were remanded in the Ilesha Correctional Centre. They were later granted bail after spending one week in the centre. At the resumption of the hearing on Wednesday, the victim’s father informed the court of his intention to discontinue the matter. The man said he was under pressure to halt the trial of the accused, adding that monarchs, landlords’ associations and community leaders had pleaded with him on behalf of the suspects. Magistrate Olusegun Ayilara, who was visibly angry by the development, requested that the mother of the victim be brought to the court. Ayilara, who immediately stopped the move to discontinue the trial, berated all those piling pressure on the victim’s father to stop the trial. He said it was not the father that was defiled, adding that it was only the victim that could stop the trial. He then adjourned the matter till December 13, 2019. Copyright PUNCH.
