Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Sisters’ Forum of the Islamic Movement has accused the Nigerian Army and the police of holding 23 girls who were allegedly arrested during the December 2015 procession by Shi’ite members in Zaria, Kaduna State. The group, in a statement in Abuja on Monday, claimed that many of the detainees were suffering from life-threatening injuries they sustained during their arrest. Reading the statement on behalf of the forum, a member, Zainab Zakariyya, said, “We would like to inform the general public that the families of 705 people that got missing over the course of the December 2015 massacre in Zaria are so anxious for their missing children. “Forty-six months after, neither the Nigerian Army nor the police are saying anything about the missing persons or their whereabouts. Even more distressing is the case of 23 abducted girls. These girls were taken away in daylight, we have their names and where they hailed from.” Copyright PUNCH.
