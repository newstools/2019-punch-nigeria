Ada Wodu, Calabar The much anticipated and publicised presentation of the 2020 budget by the Cross River State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, on Friday, did not take place because the budget proposal was not ready. The Director-General of the state’s budget office, Abeng Onoh, told journalists on Friday in his office in Calabar that the budget would be ready next week. He said, “When the governor asked us, we told him we have not finished. I just finished speaking with the consultant. “By Wednesday or Thursday, the budget will be okay. The reason for the delay did not come from us but the consultant. The network was always fluctuating. Sometimes, he will come and sit down for the network to improve. It was not the governor’s fault.” Onoh, who did not disclose the name of the consultant, said, “What happened is that nearly all the states are operating 52 digits while we are still operating 35 digits mode of codification of projects in the budget. So, we are converting from 35 digits to 52 digits. We have not really finished.” Copyright PUNCH.
