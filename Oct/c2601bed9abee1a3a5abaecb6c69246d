Peter Dada, Akure Some residents of Ido Ani in the Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State have benefited from free medical services offered by a team of medical doctors from the United States of America. The beneficiaries, who were said to be over 500, were mostly children, pregnant women, and aged people. The leader of the team and Surgeon- in-Chief of the United State’s Children Hospital, Prof. Olayinka Olutoye, said the team came annually from the United States to offer free medical services to the people. He said, “Everyone has a role to play to make Nigeria a better place; that is why I am doing my bit for my place of birth, Ido-Ani.” In his remark, the Executive Secretary of the Ondo State Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr Francis Akanbiemu, who led the state government team, described the medical mission as a huge success. “Children, pregnant women and accident victims were not left out of the programme, they were all taken care of. Family planning services were also rendered and drugs were given free to the people,” he said. The monarch of Ido Ani, Oba Olufemi Olutoye, who expressed delight over the success of the free medical mission, said it was the right way to go as everyone had his or her bit to contribute as a service to humanity and a way of making Nigeria a better place.
