The Ogun Command of Federal Road Safety Corps on Friday said that 280 people died in 569 Road Traffic Crashes in the state from January till date. The Ogun Sector Commander of FRSC, Mr Clement Oladele, made this known at the 2019 Annual Public Enlightenment Campaign of Sango-Ota FRSC Unit at Iju Garage, Ogun. The theme of the campaign was titled “Choose to Arrive Alive,” the News Agency of Nigeria reports Oladele said 1,588 persons also sustained various degrees of injury from the 569 road traffic crashes. He described the development as worrisome, noting that most of the accident victims were breadwinners with many dependants. The sector commander attributed some of the crashes to non-compliance with traffic rules and regulations. “The FRSC implore all motorists to obey traffic rules and regulations to eliminate traffic crashes on the highways,’’ he said. Oladele cautioned reckless drivers driving against traffic to desist from such act to avoid unnecessary death. He also promised that the corps would continue to intensify public enlightenment campaign in churches, mosques and motor parks to reduce crashes. He warned tricycles and motorcyclists to obtain number plates as the Federal Government had commenced issuance of rider licences. Mr Akeem Gainyu, Sango-Ota Unit Commander of FRSC, said the campaign became necessary as ‘ember months’ were characterised with upsurge in human and vehicular traffic which often resulted in increased road crashes. Earlier, , Zonal Secretary, Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria, Alhaji Lateef Deinde, urged tripper drivers to be cautious of smaller vehicles while on the highways. Copyright PUNCH.
