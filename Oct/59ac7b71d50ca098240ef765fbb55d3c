Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja A Federal High Court in Abuja has varied the bail conditions granted the convener of #RevolutionNow, Omoyele Sowore, and his co-defendant, Olawale Bakare. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu granted the order in a ruling on the application for bail variation by the duo charged with treasonable felony among others. She waived the earlier requirement that Sowore should deposit N50m  as security and reduced the amount attached to Bakare’s bail. The court had on October 4 this year granted them bail on certain conditions, which they considered stringent and which they could not meet, prompting them to apply to the court for variation. Justice Ojukwu, however, refused to vary all other bail conditions.
