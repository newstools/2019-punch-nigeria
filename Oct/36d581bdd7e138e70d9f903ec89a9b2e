Tope Omogbolagun Chairperson, Executive Council, Women in Management, Business and Public Service, Mrs Olubunmi Aboderin-Talabi, has said women often neglect their health because of the several roles they perform. Aboderin-Talabi said this at the Safari Dance for WIMBIZ which held on Saturday at the Ikeja City Mall, Lagos State. According to her, women are usually stressed since they handle many roles as a mother, caregiver, wife, employee and boss without necessarily having time to recoup lost energy. She said, “This dance was organised to call the consciousness of women to take their health more seriously and also have fun. While dancing, you exercise the body, enjoy yourself and also take your mind off the regular house chores, traffic, caring for the family and others. “Women should begin to have time for themselves so that they can rejuvenate from all the stress that they go through. A woman takes care of an average of six people daily but ignores herself, hence the need to host an event like this, something different from our conferences, roundtables, and other programmes. This is organised to help relax the mind from all the mental acumen and all.” Aboderin-Talabi also stated that the dance was to prepare people and create awareness for the forthcoming WIMBIZ conference billed for November 7 and 8, 2019 at the Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos State. WIMBIZ is a non-profit organisation that has, over the last 18 years, organised programmes that inspire, empower and advocate greater representation of women in leadership positions in the public and private sectors.
