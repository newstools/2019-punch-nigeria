It was gathered that Adeniyi had on July 17, 2016, stole a Honda Accord car with number plate KTU 712 BR belonging to one Mr Benedict Okoro from the Saint Dominic Church, Yaba, Lagos. PUNCH Metro learnt that the convict was arrested by the churchâ€™s vigilante group members when he attempted to drive the car out after the owner had parked it and entered the church auditorium.
