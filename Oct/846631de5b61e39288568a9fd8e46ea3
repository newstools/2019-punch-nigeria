Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi The Commissioner for Education, Bauchi State, Dr Aliyu Tilde, has sacked the principal of a secondary school in the state for underfeeding his students. The Principal of Hasan Usman Katsina Unity College was sacked along with two storekeepers of the school. Tilde, in a media statement in Bauchi on Wednesday, said the affected officers were found serving the food of 350 students to over 1,200 students last weekend. The commissioner who did not disclose the name of the principal, wondered why this would be done by the school when the state government had provided sufficient food items to all its 35 boarding schools before the inception of the school term. He said in the statement that a new principal had been appointed by the ministry for the school.
