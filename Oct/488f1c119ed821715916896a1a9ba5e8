He said,  “We  have invited  oil companies that are indebted to the NDDC to come and tell lawmakers why they would  not obey the laws of the country. “Some of them have confirmed that they owed the NDDC.” He said as of the time the last calculation was done, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Corporation owed N54bn, Allied oil owed $43m while Pan Ocean owed $46m. He also revealed that the Federal government owed the  NDDC over N1tn. Nwaoboshi, who expressed dissatisfaction with the failure of the oil companies to pay the NDDC, said that the Senate made efforts in the 8th National Assembly to ensure the prompt payment of money meant for the NDDC. He accused the oil companies of not disclosing their real budget saying most of the firms tampered with their annual budgets.
