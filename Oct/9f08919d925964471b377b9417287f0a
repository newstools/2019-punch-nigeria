The senator representing Imo West Senatorial District at the National Assembly, ex-Governor Rochas Okorocha, has recommended one senator per state, instead of the current three from each state of the federation. He said this will reduce cost of governance in general. Okorocha spoke during the Senate plenary on Thursday. “We must begin to make sacrifice and cut down our cost of governance by having just one Senatorial representative, instead of three (3) per state. “We should fund the productive sector of our economy,” Okorocha had said. The senator spoke in response to Senate President Ahmad Lawan’s concerns that Nigeria needs to have an economy that provide jobs and creates wealth. “We must ensure that our procurement process is well monitored. There must be efficiency and prudence in the way we do procurement,” Lawan said. “We need diversification in various sectors of our economy like the agricultural sector, solid minerals and tourism. “The mono-economy is not working for this country,” Lawal had said.
