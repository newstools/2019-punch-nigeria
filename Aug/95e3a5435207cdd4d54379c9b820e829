Ademola Babalola, Ibadan Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji on Monday received in his palace all the 21 ‘new kings’ elevated by former Governor Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo state. The monarch, marking his 91st birthday today, was hosting Chief Yemi Soladoye-led Central Council of Ibadan indigenes when the visitors arrived. The Otun Olubadan, High Chief Lekan Balogun, led all other high chiefs including Baales in Ibadan lesser cities who were on August 27, 2017, given crowns by the former Governor in a single day. Until recently when Balogun embraced reconciliation with four other high chiefs, others stuck to their guns and distanced themselves from palace activities. But around 1:15pm on Monday, Balogun led other aggrieved high chiefs, including Baales, who had stayed away from the palace for over two years. Amidst fanfare, they all prostrated to the monarch one after the other as he (Olubadan) welcomed them with open hands. Two years ago, the elevation/coronation of chiefs, polarised the once united Olubadan-In-Council as the monarch opposed the said reform carried out by the state government. Olubadan also found an ally in one of the high chiefs, Rashidi Ladoja, a former Governor of the state who dissociated himself from the elevation and instituted an action in court. Ladoja won in a landmark judgment delivered by Justice Aiki who described all the processes that led to the installation of new kings as illegal, null, void and of no effect. Ajimobi, however, appealed the judgment until his successor, Governor Seyi Makinde, last week began an out-of-court settlement for reconciliation.
