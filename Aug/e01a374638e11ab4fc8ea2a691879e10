Uduk noted that SEC was working hard to ensure the reduction of e-Dividend in the capital market, describing it as an undesirable feature She said the sub-committees of the CMC passed a resolution to invite the National Information Technology Department Agency to the next CMC meeting to make a presentation on data regulations and protection for investors. Uduk said, “SEC is taking these steps to combat the issue of identity theft in the market. “Other key initiatives embarked on include our partnership with the University of Lagos to promote capital market education and attract experts to the industry. We are also taking capital market education to primary and secondary schools so that we can capture these young ones.” Uduk stated that SEC was working in partnership with the Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council to inculcate capital market studies into the curriculum of schools. She said the aim was to ensure that children grew up to understand the technicalities of the market. Copyright PUNCH.
