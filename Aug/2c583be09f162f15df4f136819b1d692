Tunde Oyekola The Ilorin Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Friday arrested Oyediran Joseph, said to be one of the “most wanted” suspected Internet fraudsters by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States. EFCC said the 36-year-old suspect was arrested in Ilorin, Kwara State, recently. The Zonal Head of the commission, Sharu Isyaku, told reporters at a news briefing on Friday that “the 36-year-old suspect had benefited from about N60m from the loot via Western Union Transfer.” The Ilorin zonal office of EFCC covers Kwara, Kogi and Ekiti states. The FBI had arrested no fewer than 78 Nigerians, who were indicted for internet fraud and cyber crime-related offences amounting to millions of dollars in the US. Isyaku said, “Just last three weeks, the US authority had written to us for assistance in tracking and possible arrest and prosecution of two most wanted FBI suspects in Nigeria. “The commission acceded to their request. The commission has been supportive of the activities of the FBI and every other foreign counterpart whose responsibility is similar or analogous to ours.” He revealed that the zone had traced four properties linked to some cyber crime suspects in choice areas at Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State. He said the properties include supermarket and plaza with market value of between N800m and N1bn. Copyright PUNCH.
