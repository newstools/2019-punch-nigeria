Feyisayo Popoola The Nigerian Stock Exchange has partnered JP Morgan Chase to facilitate in-depth capacity building programme on derivatives market. According to a statement on Wednesday, the collaboration with JP Morgan is expected to promote the development of derivatives in Nigeria by helping to bridge the knowledge gap on derivatives investments and trading strategies through knowledge transfer. The NSE said the partnership was consistent with its commitment to develop a thriving derivatives market in Nigeria. It said it believed that the introduction of derivatives would deepen the market, enhance liquidity and help to mitigate price, duration and other financial risks that might arise from sophisticated financial transactional activities. The NSE kicked off its derivatives project in 2015, following a market-wide feasibility study concluded in 2014, which pointed to prospects for product creation in the equity, debt, currency, energy and commodity markets. A team from JP Morgan Chase, led by the Global Head, Corporate Bank, Leenart Sjoerd, visited the NSE on Wednesday and were honoured with a closing gong ceremony. Copyright PUNCH.
