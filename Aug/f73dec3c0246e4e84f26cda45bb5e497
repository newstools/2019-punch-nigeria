An Edo  group  based in the United Kingdom, Benin Trust UK, has praised President Muhammadu Buhari for  appointing ex-Edo State Deputy Governor, Pius Odubu, as  Chairman of the new board of the Niger Delta Development Commission. But the group kicked against the alleged condemnation  of the former House of Representatives member’s appointment by some groups in Niger Delta, insisting Odubu deserved the job. In a statement  signed  by  its Board of Trustees  consisting of  Dr Samuel Egharevba, Dr Charles Omorodion, Dr Stephen  Uwuilekhue, Job Eghobamien and Gentle  Aivihenyor, Benin Trust UK  urged Buhari to shun critics of Odubu’s appointment. The  group  said Odubu’s  appointment  would help accelerate   the development  of   Niger Delta. The statement said, “Dr Pius Odubu is a statesman whose positive interventions in the Niger Delta region, even as a private citizen, have helped to alleviate the burden of the people in many respects. Over the years, he has distinguished himself and led the way in policy discussions and developmental projects focused on developing the Niger Delta region and reversing the environmental problems it faces.” It added, “It has come to our notice that some persons are expressing contrived angst upon the announcement of Dr Pius Odubu’s appointment.” Copyright PUNCH.
