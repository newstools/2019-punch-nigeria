Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic  Party, Uche Secondus, has  claimed  more people have  been killed  under the Muhammadu Buhari  government than during the  1970 civil war. Secondus  made the claim   during a  meeting of the Ogun State wing of the party at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta, on Wednesday. The PDP  chief   said  his  party  would stop  violent deaths  in the country if elected in the 2023 polls. He said, “For how long can we continue to be oppressed, intimidated  and   continue to kill ourselves? So many killings now in the country than we had  during the civil war. “The people that have  been killed since the inception of the APC government  are many  that you can’t place records, because we wake up to hear news of killings on a daily basis.” On  his plan to unite the party ahead of the 2023 elections, Secondus said Ogun had  taken the lead towards the  move to unite the PDP in other states. He also said the party would  hold its    ward, local government area  and state  congresses next year. He said, “Since Ogun state has started this unification move, other states will follow in the interest of our great party. We must all come together after we have passed   through   pains.” A leader of the PDP in the state, Oladipupo  Adebutu, said Dapo Abiodun would not have won the March 9 governorship poll if he had represented the party.
