He said that the students refused to be checked by the policemen, who were on patrol. He said, “The students were stopped by the policemen on patrol on Sunday night, and when they were asked to open the bag they held, they refused, that was what caused an argument between them, leading to one of them to slightly push the lady. But because the lady was drunk, she fell down and got injured. “In spite of that, as I am speaking with you now, the policeman in question has been arrested and will face trial today ( Tuesday). He would definitely be punished. ” The President of the FUTA Student Union Government, Abraham Esedere, said he was at the police headquarters over the matter and promised to call back. “I’m at the police headquarters, I will call you back after I leave here,” he told our correspondent on the telephone.
