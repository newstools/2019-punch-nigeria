Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja A total of 2,737 Nigerians who participated in the just-concluded pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia have so far been airlifted back home. Those who have been airlifted are among the about 65,000 Nigerian pilgrims who participated in the spiritual exercise this year. The airlifting started on Saturday and pilgrims that have been airlifted include those from Katsina, Kogi, Ogun, Zamfara, Lagos and Oyo states. Six flights have so far taken off from Saudi Arabia for that purpose. Meanwhile, the  Secretary to the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria, Alhaji Ahmad Maigari, told journalists that arrangements were being made for about 100 Nigerian pilgrims yet to visit Madinah to do so. Maigari explained that the affected pilgrims arrived in Saudi Arabia at a time Hajj rites had started and they were moved directly to Makkah from Jeddah Airport. This, he said, made it impossible for them to make the  trip to Madinah. According to him, the pilgrims concerned will make the Madinah trip between Wednesday and Thursday before  moving  to Jeddah, from where they will be airlifted to Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH.
