Dayo Ojerinde The Chairman of Innovate 1 Pay, Mr Mahmood Ahmadu, has called on financial service providers to reflect customer expectations in secure and quick transfer of funds. He said this in a statement to announce the expansion of its firm’s operations and provision of financial technology services to African expatriates in Dubai. “With the maturing of financial markets in Africa, we have expanded our presence to a total of 56 countries currently, and with the promise that the new UAE visa regime holds for African professionals, we believe the prospects for growth in addressing this demographic is very promising indeed. “The next generation of financial services needs to reflect customer expectations around the secure and quick transfer of funds. Our relationship with the government bodies and comprehensive presence in the African market positions Innovate 1 Pay uniquely in being able to leverage these strengths and amplify them with the use of appropriate and user-friendly technologies,” Ahmadu said. Also, the firm, Mr Anthony Nwachukwu, stressed the need to make a concerted effort to extend financial inclusion in Africa. He said, “Africa is home to 40 per cent of the people in the world who lack access to banking services. And we at Innovate 1 Pay see our business mission within the context of this larger social goal. Bringing financial inclusion to all is possibly one of the most important steps in empowering untapped human potential, more equitable wealth distribution and a universally prosperous world.” Copyright PUNCH.
