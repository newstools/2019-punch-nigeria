Raphael Ede, Enugu GUNMEN on Sunday attacked the Ikirike Police Station in Enugu State. It was gathered that the hoodlums came to the station on the pretext that they wanted to report an emergency situation and unleashed terror on the station. Source told our correspondent that the hoodlums, numbering about seven, swooped on the policemen on duty, adding that about five policemen were seriously wounded. A police source also told our correspondent that the gunmen took away weapons from the station’s armoury. He said what saved the day was the timely reinforcement from the Mobile 3 Police Unit and the Police Detective College located on the Agbani Road. When contacted on the telephone, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Ebere Amaraizu, confirmed the attack. He told our correspondent that the hoodlums came to the station pretending as if they wanted to lodge a complaint and launched the attack. On whether there was fatality, Amaraizu said no police personnel was killed. He stated, “It was an incident, which had to do with an attack by some hoodlums, who came on the pretext of lodging a complaint in the early hours of today (Sunday) and under that guise, attacked our men although there was no death. Our injured personnel are responding to treatment. ‘The quick intervention of reinforcement teams as despatched by the Commissioner of Police did not give the hoodlums the opportunity to have the upper hand.” The police spokesman added that the CP, Suleiman Balarabe, had directed a full-scale investigation into the incident with a view to unmasking those behind it.
