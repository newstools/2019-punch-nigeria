Raphael Ede The Enugu State Police Command on Friday paraded the suspected killers of two priests of Enugu Catholic Diocese. The police also paraded the suspected kidnappers of the traditional ruler of Obom-Agbogugu, Igwe Sunday Orji, and his wife, who were kidnapped on August 3, along the Enugu-Port-Harcourt Expressway. This is just as another priest, Rev. Fr. Chimezie Ani, was said to have escaped an assassination by unidentified gunmen. The deceased priests, Fr. Paul Offu and Fr. Clement Ugwu, were killed on August 1 and March 14, 2019, respectively, by gunmen. The Commissioner of Police, Suleiman Balarabe, who paraded the suspected killers of the priests along with other 30 suspects arrested for various criminal offences, said “the command had devised measures to protect Catholic priests from such incidents in the future.” He said that one Ibrahim Adamu, aged 25, from Taraba State, and Idris Tobe, aged 28, were arrested in connection with the killing of Offu, while three other suspects were still at large. The CP promised that those who attacked Ani would soon be arrested. Copyright PUNCH.
