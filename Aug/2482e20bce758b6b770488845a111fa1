Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia Pensioners under the umbrella of Abia Concerned Pensioners on Thursday protested their unpaid pension and gratuities. The pensioners in a statement by its Chairman, Amaugo Daniel, and Secretary, Okezie Emeka, said, “We have been dehumanised and subjected to unimaginable deaths, chronic sicknesses and unfilled promises by the state government. “That is why we embarked on a state-wide prayer summit/protest to inform Abians and the world in general about the inhuman treatment we are facing from 1998 to 2019.” Governor Okezie Ikpeazu had pleaded with pensioners and other workers in state to be patient with him over the pensions and salaries owed them during a state-wide broadcast to mark the 28th anniversary of the creation of the state on August 27. “Let me use this opportunity to plead with pensioners for their patience as steps are being taken to ensure a more efficient pensions administration regime in Abia State,” he had said.
