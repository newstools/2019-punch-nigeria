Residents of a municipality in southern Mexico have forced their mayor to wear a dress, after which they paraded him around town. The residents held their mayor for four days, during which they also made him to ‘beg for alms’ from motorists. The mayor incurred the residents’ anger when he failed to deliver ‘democracy dividends’ such as water and other social amenities. According to newspaper El Diario de Mexico, referencing a tweet, residents of San Andrés Puerto Rico captured Mayor Javier Jimenez, from Huixtán province, and marched him around in a long dark skirt and frilly white blouse with ruffles and flowery embroidery. Another official, Luis Ton, was also deemed deficient and was also clad in a bright pink dress with white polka dots. One of the key complaints, local news outlets say, is that Jimenez has not fulfilled his campaign promise to allocate three million pesos (about $158,000) for improvements to the town’s water system, among other things. While the officials walked in women’s garb, residents held placards describing what they saw as the two politicians’ failings. El Diario de Mexico said the mayor regretted his inaction, and explained to the residents that he had been trying to fulfill his campaign promises. He said there was no more money in government coffers because it has been given to various municipalities. “Jimenez and Ton were also forced to solicit funds from passing motorists, many of whom seemed to ridicule them, “The begging was to enable them to generate funds for improving the water system. “The two politicians had been detained by the residents for at least four days,” the medium reported.
