Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi Following the closure of Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, Ethiopian Airlines says it plans to begin flight operations from Port Harcourt International airport. The airline’s Chief Operating Officer, Mesfin Tasew, who made this known on Thursday, said the service from Port Harcourt would begin on September 3. Tasew said Ethiopian Airlines remained dedicated to serving the South East region of the country, adding that to achieve that, the airline would continue operating into Port Harcourt until Enugu airport was ready for use. The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria had about two weeks ago announced the planned closure of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport for repairs, and subsequently shut it down on August 24. Tasew said, “We have planned to shift the Enugu flight to Port Harcourt and we will start operations on September 3. “We will continue operating from this airport until Enugu airport becomes ready. When Enugu is ready, we will go back to Enugu.” He also stated that Ethiopia Airlines planned to partner with a Nigerian carrier to establish a Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility.
