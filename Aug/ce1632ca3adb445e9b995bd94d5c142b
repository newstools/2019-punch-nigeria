Ademola Babalola, Ibadan The Oyo State Government has said it will run an all-inclusive budgetary system that will put into consideration the overall needs of its citizens. The state Commissioner for Budget and Planning, Mr Adeniyi Farinto, said this while receiving delegates of the Dawn Commission who paid him a courtesy visit in his office in Ibadan on Thursday. The team visited the commissioner to intimate him of their findings and recommendations on how Oyo State as a member state of the South-West regional body could have a strong planning and budgeting architecture. The commissioner, who spoke to newsmen after the visit, said, “The two arms: budget and planning, combined together will synergize so that we can have a budget that will be derived from strategic planning and will be open to the public. “There will be proper coordination of all departments in the area of data, projects, monitoring and evaluation so that whatever is budgeted for will be the needs of the citizens. This will make the citizens happy with government’s projects because such projects are the real needs of the people rather than projects embarked upon without carrying the citizens along.” The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Budget and Planning, Mrs Mofoluke Adebiyi, said the establishment of a Ministry of Budget and Planning was essential for proper and inclusive socio-economic system for the development of the state. The Dawn Commission’s spokesperson, Mr Tosin Oke, applauded the state government for establishing a single institution, aimed at coordinating budget and planning which the state hitherto lacked.
