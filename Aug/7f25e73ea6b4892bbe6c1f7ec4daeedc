Peter Dada, Akure The Nigeria Society of Engineers, the Ondo State Chapter, says it is empowered to arrest any building professional found to be involved in using substandard materials or linked to a defective construction project. The NSE called on the builders to engage qualified engineers to supervise their projects in a bid to eradicate cases of building collapse in the state. The Chairman of the NSE, Ondo Chapter, Mrs Christiana Ijagbemi, stated this during the 40th anniversary of the state chapter of the society. The theme of the anniversary is ‘Sustainable approach to infrastructural development’. According to her, building collapse is mostly caused by fake engineers. She said, “We want to advise our people to always engage qualified engineers to do structural analysis on their project. But the problem is that many people don’t involve engineers in the building project. “It is not only engineers that involve in building collapse, particularly high-rise buildings; we have other building professionals, such as surveyor, architect and quantity surveyor. Errors from anyone of the professionals can cause a building to collapse. But we are trying to put a stop to this.” Ijagbemi stated that members of the NSE had been going round to monitor building construction in the state, adding that anyone found using substandard materials or involved in defective construction would be arrested and handed over to law enforcement agents.
