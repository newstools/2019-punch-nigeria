Raphael Ede, Enugu The Enugu West People’s Parliament on Monday condemned the threat by Indigenous People of Biafra to attack South-East  governors  and other Igbo leaders. Reacting to the attack on former Deputy President of the Senate and Senator representing Enugu West Senatorial District, Chief Ike Ekweremadu, by some  IPOB members  in Germany on Saturday, the group described Ekweremadu’s assailants as   ‘’miscreants masquerading themselves as those fighting for the Igbo agenda”. Spokesman for the  parliament Jonathan Ivoke urged Igbo leaders not to be distracted by IPOB’s threat to attack them. The group  said  Ekweremadu had done so much for his constituents, the Igbo nation, Nigeria and West Africa. Ivoke  insisted Ekweremadu  was instrumental in ensuring  IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu getting bail when he was detained by the Federal Government. He said, “Ekweremadu has urged the President (Muhammadu Buhari) to address the obvious marginalisation of the Igbo and this shows the extent of love he has for his people. It therefore means that an assault on him is an assault on the entire Igbo nation.’’ The group called for the arrest and prosecution of those who planned and carried out the attack on the senator. The group said, “Other Igbo in  the diaspora must take note of the threat of these miscreants masquerading as those fighting for the Igbo agenda and ensure that adequate security is provided  for  all genuine Igbo activities abroad.’’ Copyright PUNCH.
