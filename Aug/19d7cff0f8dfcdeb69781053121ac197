Adeniyi Olugbemi, Sokoto A Sokoto  agro-industrialist, Alhaji Nura Attajiri, has commended the Federal Government for its efforts to diversify food production in the country. Addressing a press conference in Sokoto on Tuesday, Attajiri, who is the  owner  of Attajiri Rice Mill,  said he was happy  that the FG was interested in farming. He said  the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme had boosted  food production in Nigeria. Attajiri  said,  “Nigerians will now concentrate on the consumption of local rice and other food items.” “The production of local rice will  also be intensified. However, the provision of some inputs and implements such as improved seeds, assorted fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides and low interest loans, among others, should be given due emphasis.” Copyright PUNCH.
