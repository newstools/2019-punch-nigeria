Connecticut Police have caught a group of six elderly men and a woman having sex in the Grace Richardson conservation area. The six seniors range in age from 62 to 85, and they were engaged in group sex. According to the Fairfield Police Department, the culprits were intercepted on August 9. The Connecticut Post identified the elderly suspects as Joyce Butler, 85 — the only woman participating in the orgy — her husband Richard Butler, 82; Daniel Dobbins, 67; Otto D. Williams, 62; Charles L. Ardito, 75; and John Linartz, 62. All six were arrested and charged with breach of peace. One of the suspects, 67-year-old Daniel Dobbins, was previously charged with second-degree breach of peace by Connecticut police after witnesses said they spotted him walking around a park naked. Police later found him inside his car “with his shirt and shorts draped over him and no underwear.” One of them had previously been arrested in 2017 for public nudity at another park in the area, it was reported. “The group was apprehended as part of a surveillance operation conducted by law enforcement, as the park is widely known on the web as a place to meet up for casual sex,” the Police said. “The elderly lovers are now facing charges ranging from disturbing the peace to public indecency,” it added. The Connecticut Times reports that the Grace Richardson Conservation is listed online as a popular spot for public sex. The park has been advertised on at least one ‘City Hook-up Guide’ as a meet-up spot, alongside other Fairfield locations, including a commuter parking lot and a local McDonald’s. Police say they will continue to monitor those sites, as well as internet listings, in order to keep public spaces “appropriate and safe.”
