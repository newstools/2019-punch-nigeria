Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe Operatives of the Lagos State Police Command have rescued a suspected female kidnapper, Omowumi Damilohun, from being lynched by a mob. Damilohun, who was beaten and stripped naked by the mob, was rescued by cops from the Ijora Badia Police Station. PUNCH Metro learnt that the 38-year-old had on August 21 allegedly kidnapped a three-year-old boy on Matiminu Street in the Ijora Badia area of the state. It was gathered that Damilohun reportedly abducted the boy in front of his parents’ residence on the pretext that she wanted him to show her the way to her destination. An eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the three-year-old was rescued when his brother raised the alarm. He said, “The woman was caught when she was trying to run away with the child; it was the boy’s brother, who raised the alarm that attracted their mother, who in turn cried for help, and the boy was rescued from the woman. “The woman picked the boy in front of their house on the pretext that she wanted him to lead her to one Alhaja’s house, but the child’s brother raised the alarm. The woman was almost lynched by youths in the street before the police came to rescue her.” When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, who confirmed the incident, stated that the suspect would be charged after the completion of the investigation.
