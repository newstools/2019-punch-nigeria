Tunde Oyekola Kwara state House of Assembly on Tuesday directed its committees on Land, Housing and Urban Development and Tertiary Education to investigate alleged sale of two aircrafts belonging to the state government by the rector of the state-owned Aviation College, Ilorin. The assembly, at its plenary, also directed the committee to look into the illegal acquisition, appropriation and conversion of government property with survey number KWG. 927 and LAN/G. 1071, situated at Iloffa Road by Civil Service Clinic G.R.A Ilorin by private individual. The directive followed the presentation of two petitions to the assembly by the House leader, Olawoyin Mogaji, and the Chief Whip, Yusuf Atoyebi, which were read at the floor of the Assembly. The two aircrafts, said to belong to the college, were allegedly sold for N5m by the rector of the college. The petitions on the sale of the two aircrafts were written by Kwara Restoration Agenda and signed by Alhaji Ibraheem Giwa (Kwara Central), Michael Adeleke (Kwara South) and Umar Ndana (Kwara North). The petition on the illegal acquisition of the land earmarked for the building of a government secretariat when the state was created in 1967 said the letter for the illegal conversion and acquisition was signed by one Akewusola M. Oba. The assembly gave a two-week ultimate to the committee to submit its report. Meanwhile, the state House of Assembly has approved the dissolution of three statutory commissions inaugurated in May. The affected commissions, according to the assembly, included the Kwara State House of Assembly Service Commission, the Kwara State Civil Service Commission, and the Kwara State Independent Electoral Commission.
