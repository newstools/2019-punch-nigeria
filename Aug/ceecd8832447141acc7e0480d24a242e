A 15-year-old Afghan boy fatally stabbed a compatriot and injured two others at the Moria migrant camp on the island of Lesbos, state agency ANA said Sunday. The incident occurred late on Saturday in the unit for unaccompanied minors when the boy attacked a group of other Afghan teens with a knife. The cause of the fight is not yet known. Some 600 minors are currently staying in the camp, which is designed to house up to 160, ANA said. At present, thousands of migrants and refugees spend months in Moria and other overcrowded island camps before their applications can be processed.
