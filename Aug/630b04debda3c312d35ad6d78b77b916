Tony Okafor, Awka One person was killed on Tuesday while many others were injured in a clash between the police and some youths in Onitsha, Anambra State. The incident, which occurred at the Aba Park, off the Owerri/Onitsha Road, paralysed activities in the area for many hours. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Haruna Mohammed, confirmed the incident. He said, “There was an attempt by some miscreants to disarm the police at the new Aba Park, Owerri Road, when a police patrol team went there following intelligence reports that two armed robbery suspects, who escaped from lawful custody, were hiding in the park. “The hoodlums, who emerged from an uncompleted building near the park, descended on the policemen in a bid to overpower them and snatched their rifles.
