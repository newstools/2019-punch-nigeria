Chukwudi Akasike Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said that the State Security Council will deploy more security personnel to troubled Ogoni communities with a view to restoring peace. Wike, who spoke on Saturday when he led the State Security Service Commanders to Kono-Boue and Kereken-Boue Towns in Khana Local Government Area, said that the security agencies had been mobilised to go after the cultists operating in parts of Ogoniland. “We will do everything possible to make sure that those involved in these criminal cult activities don’t go free. “You have to cooperate with us to get the killers. Those who have perpetrated these crimes are known to community members. No armed robber operates in a place without local support. Therefore, support us with credible information.
