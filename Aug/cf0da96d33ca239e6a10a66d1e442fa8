A 15-year-old boy has allegedly staged his own kidnap and demanded the sum of N500,000 as ransom. The minor, who was paraded in Jos on Thursday, told newsmen that he initiated the plan with his friends in order to enable him to buy clothes and celebrate his graduation. “I was the one who initiated the plan and not my friends. I wanted my father to give me money for clothes and to also celebrate my graduation,” he said. Briefing newsmen on the arrest of the minor, the Commissioner of Police, Plateau command, Isaac Akinmoyede, said that five persons were arrested in a case of criminal conspiracy and kidnapping, including the victim, who stage-managed his own kidnap.
