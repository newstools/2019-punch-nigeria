Police have arraigned a 39-year-old man, Yemi Falana, before an Ado Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly threatening to take the life of a Catholic priest. The police prosecutor, Inspector Johnson Okunade, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on August 22, 2019, around noon at Araromi Obo in Igbemo-Ekiti in the Irepodun/Ifelodun Local Government Area of Ekiti State. He said the defendant unlawfully threatened to kill one Rev. Fr. Theophilus Olaiya with a knife. “The defendant also caused a breach of the peace with his behaviour towards the priest, which made him to commit an offence contrary to  Section 86 (2) of the Criminal Code, Cap C 16, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012,” Okunade stated. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty as his counsel, Mr Peter Oluwanisola, prayed the court to grant him bail in liberal terms, adding that he would not jump bail. Oluwanisola said Falana would always make himself available for trial.
