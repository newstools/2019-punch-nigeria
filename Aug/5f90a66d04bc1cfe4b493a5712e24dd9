Ademola Babalola, Ibadan The appeal filed by former Governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi, challenging the nullification of all the processes that led to the crowing of 21 kings in a single day in Ibadan may soon be withdrawn by the incumbent Governor Seyi Makinde, The PUNCH learnt on Wednesday. A two-page ‘terms of settlement’ dated August 20 and signed by Ladoja’s  counsel stated the procedure for settlement. Tagged, ‘official service,’ and received by the Registrar of the Court of Appeal on Tuesday, agreed that the report of the “the Boade-led commission of inquiry created disharmony.” It also observed the fact that the new administration of Oyo State would stand on the of rule of law and the parties also recognised that the House of Assembly had not amended the Chiefs Law of Oyo State. The need for truce was further premised on the fact that amendment could have probably given legal backing to the gazette that led to the installation of the 21 new kings. The terms for truce stated further that the parties had met and “agreed that all gazettes affecting the chieftaincy laws of Ibadanland issued during the pendency of the appeal be set aside.” An aide of Makinde told our correspondent in confidence that the governor wished to discontinue the matter where Ajimobi left it, adding that, “the governor will reconcile all parties involved to foster unity and harmony in the protection of the tradition of Ibadanland as relates to the chieftaincy laws of Ibadanland.” Ajimobi had, on Sunday August 27, 2017 crowned all the 21 kings. Ladoja, who was also a beneficiary, stayed away from the ceremony and instituted a court action, which gave him victory. Copyright PUNCH.
