Tony Okafor, Awka The Minister of State for  Environment, Sharon Ikeazor,  has warned pensioners against falling victims to fraudsters. The immediate past Executive Secretary of  the Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate  gave the warning on Wednesday during the inauguration of PTAD liaison office in Awka, Anambra State. She told  pensioners  not to  deal with unauthorised persons regarding  pension matters. Ikeazor promised that  PTAD  would  have  a permanent database for pensioners across the country. The minister  added, “I’m urging you not to patronise scammers in  the name of facilitating the resolution of pensioners’ complaints and payment of entitlements. “Always contact our offices or through our various channels on pension  issues. We’ve dedicated telephone lines you can contact us. “We a want to discourage and stop our senior citizens from travelling long distances to get their complaints  and  other issues resolved.” Ikeazor praised  Governor Willie Obiano for allocating space for the liaison office, urging  the retirees to take advantage of the facilities there  to improve their quality of life. The  Executive Secretary of PTAD, Dr Chioma Ejikeme, applauded her predecessor’s  legacy, pledging to build on her achievements. She said, “In the past pensioners came with mats to collect their entitlements. There was no dignity, rather it was frustrating and humiliating for the retirees. “But the story is no longer the same with the coming on board of  Ikeazor.” Copyright PUNCH.
