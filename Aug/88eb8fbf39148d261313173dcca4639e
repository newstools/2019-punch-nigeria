Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti House of Assembly on Monday invited eight local government chairmen who have been on suspension since December last year, for an interface with the joint Committee on Public Petitions and Public Accounts. The Assembly had suspended the chairmen and councillors of the 16 council areas of the state, but recalled the elected officials for eight of the councils in July, leaving the chairmen of Oye, Ise/Orun, Ekiti East, Ikere, Efon, Ido/Osi, Emure and Ilejemeje and their councillors on suspension. The House Majority Leader, Chief Gboyega Aribisogan, in a statement, said the suspended council chairmen should appear before the House Committee on Public Petitions and Public Accounts on Friday.
