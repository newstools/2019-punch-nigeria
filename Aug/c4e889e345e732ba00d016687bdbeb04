The NYSC Coordinator in the state, Alhaji Ahidjo Yahaya, confirmed the development on Saturday. He said “The two corps members were caught through a security report from the DG NYSC Brig. Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim. I got the report from the DG that the two of them were carrying fake certificates. Based on that, he set out the security network to trap them and they were trapped.” Yahaya stated that the two corps members had allegedly confessed to have committed the offence. He added “We will like to follow due process in handling the case by bringing them before the camp court today (Saturday) before they would be decamped.” Copyright PUNCH.
