The deceased’s mother, Franca Ike, said the victim was in the house when her father climbed the tree. She said her daughter was attracted by the cry of her father for help as the tree branch he clung to broke off. Franca stated, “I had warned my husband several times to stop climbing trees to no avail. He was on the tree plucking pears when the branch he was standing on broke. “He fell on another branch and as he clung helplessly unto that one, he called for help. My daughter, who heard the call, ran out to the backyard and met her father falling after he had slipped from the second branch.
