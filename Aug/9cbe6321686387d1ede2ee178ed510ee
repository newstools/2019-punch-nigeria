Adelani Adepegba, Abuja A Federal High Court judge, Justice  Idrissa Saleh, has been declared missing after he went out in a taxi and has not returned home since Saturday. It was learnt that his family, who are worried about his safety,  reported the incident to the police after Saleh failed to return home after discharging himself from a hospital at the Central Business District, Abuja. A family member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the judge left the hospital where he was being treated for an undisclosed ailment without informing the management. He said, “Justice Saleh was admitted to the hospital and he left in a taxi without disclosing his whereabouts to anyone. The management of the hospital was not aware of his movement. “I think he has a problem which he hasn’t shared with anyone. But the police are treating it as a missing person’s case and they are searching for him.” Our correspondent learnt that the judge was not with his phone,  making it difficult for the police to find him.
