Sampson Itode,  Port Harcourt The Nigerian Army has insisted it didn’t arrest suspected cultist, Boboski Lenyie. Boboski operates in Gokana, Khana and Tai local government areas of Rivers State. Governor Nyesom Wike on Thursday stated that soldiers captured the dreaded cultist. The governor made the announcement barely 24 hours after he placed a N30m bounty on the suspect.
