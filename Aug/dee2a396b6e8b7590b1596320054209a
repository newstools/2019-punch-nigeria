The International Air Transport Association had last week, in its global passenger traffic results, said flight operations based on passenger demand on the African continent had been benefitting from a generally supportive economic backdrop, including improved economic stability in several countries as well as increased air connectivity. The IATA had said in early 2019 that the year had started on a positive note, with healthy passenger demand in line with the 10-year trend line. According to an airline source who did not want to be quoted, election years generally come with surge in passenger traffic. A member of the Aviation Roundtable Initiative, and Head, Research and Corporate Travel of Zenith Consult and Travel, Mr Olumide Ohunayo, said the surge in passenger travel in the first six months could be adduced to the political campaign and other activities within that period. “We had about four to five days that airlines didn’t fly but the days preceding those days, people moved from one point to another for campaign, rallies and meetings. He said, “In doing this, businesses had to quickly conclude before the elections to ensure they were able to sort themselves out before the period, this made travel to increase.” Ohunayo, however, explained that beyond the general elections, the insecurity in the country had made road travel dangerous making more people to opt for air travel. “Due to kidnapping and banditry, all middle-class travellers who were a bit stingy about flying are now doing so,” he said. He stated that the surge should not be seen as an increase in economic activities but an increase in insecurity inland travel. Copyright PUNCH.
