Feyisayo Popoola United Capital Plc has launched its investment application, InvestNow, on iOS platform. The company said in a statement that the app was launched as part of its plans to broaden its retail reach while enhancing capabilities to handle a more diverse clientele. The statement read in part, “InvestNow is a simplified investment application developed to boost accessibility of investment options while enabling one to make returns on one’s investments. “The new InvestNow iOS app debuts with an improved, intuitive and user-friendly interface, which allows users to easily sign up, choose an investment product, open an account, fund it and gain returns all from their mobile phones.” United Capital added that the app was structured in such a way to allow users to set up recurrent direct debit transactions, which would automatically make deposits into their investment accounts from their regular bank accounts. The Group Chief Executive Officer, United Capital, Mr Peter Ashade, said while aligning with the company’s ongoing retail strategy, the upgrades in the app represented another step in the series of innovations aimed at positioning the company as a future-facing organisation. He said, “By providing seamless and delightful user experience to our clients, we are taking our award-winning investment options to more people to help them make the intelligent choice, and in the long run, deepen our financial inclusion drive.” Copyright PUNCH.
