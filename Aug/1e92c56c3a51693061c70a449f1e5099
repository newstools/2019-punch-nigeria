Nexford University has announced its ‘Entrepreneurship Scholarship’ and $200,000 startup funding, with a mission to empower next-generation leaders across the world. “The world needs more entrepreneurs. But millions of people struggle to get the education and skills they need. Nexford University plans to change that,” the university said in a statement on Thursday. “The world needs more doers,” said Fadl Al Tarzi, Nexford’s Chief Executive Officer. “We thought about what we can do to help them. If you’re a doer, you won’t let anything stop you, be it your physical location, lack of experience or even lack of funding.” Tarzi said, “Having said that, we want everyone to succeed – we want to empower people with the tools they need to increase their chances of success.” Copyright PUNCH.
