Oladimeji Ramon A former governor of Abia, Orji Uzor Kalu, and two others rested their case on Thursday in their 12-year-old trial for an alleged fraud of N7.65bn. Justice Mohammed Idris, sitting at the Federal High Court in Lagos, directed the prosecution and the defence to file their final written addresses. The judge adjourned till October 22, 2019 for the parties to adopt their final written addresses and canvass final arguments. The judge is expected to fix a date for judgment after taking final arguments on October 22. Thursday’s proceedings brought the case, which started in 2007, to a close. The case had journeyed all the way to the Supreme Court for eight years before returning to the high court for trial in September 2016. Standing trial alongside Kalu are his company, Slok Nigeria Limited; and Udeh Udeogu, who was Director of Finance and Accounts at the Abia State Government House during Kalu’s tenure as governor. In an amended 39 counts, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission accused them of conspiring and diverting N7.65bn from the coffers of the state. The prosecuting counsel, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), said the ex-governor violated Section 17(c) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2004, and was liable to be punished under Section 16 of the same Act. Apart from the N7.1bn, which he was accused of laundering, the ex-governor and the other defendants were also accused of receiving a total of N460m allegedly stolen from the Abia State Government treasury between July and December 2002. But the defendants pleaded not guilty. To prove the allegations, the prosecution called 19 witnesses. The defendants testified on behalf of themselves. Copyright PUNCH.
