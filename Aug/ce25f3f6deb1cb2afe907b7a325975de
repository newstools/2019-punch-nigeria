Olaleye Aluko The  Nigerian Air Force  says it killed  scores of Boko Haram fighters  in the Bula Korege area of Borno State   after launching a major offensive on the Sambisa Forest to get rid of the terrorists hiding there. The Air Task Force deployed two fighter jets on Friday as part of Operation Lafiya Dole in the ongoing efforts to contain the insurgents within the Lake Chad region. The Air Force said on Saturday in a statement  that it would  sustain its  operations against the terrorists in the North-East, operating in concert with surface forces. The NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said, “Scores of Boko Haram terrorists have been neutralised and their hideout destroyed at Bula Korege on the fringes of the Sambisa Forest in Borno State. “This was achieved on Friday in devastating air strikes conducted by the Air Task Force as part of missions in the ongoing Operation Green Sweep 3. “The target was designated for attack based on credible intelligence reports, which were further corroborated by a series of Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance missions that established the settlement  was a major hub of BHT activities. “The ATF therefore detailed two Alpha Jets to attack the target area. The air strikes were synchronised for maximum effect, recording devastating hits on the terrorists’ hideout and killing several of their fighters, as captured in the Battle Damage  Assessment footage.” Copyright PUNCH.
