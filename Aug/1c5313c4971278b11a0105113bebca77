The police spokesman added that if the hotel management was able to prove that they did what they were supposed to do, they would be let off the hook. “The idea of inviting the hotel operators is to ascertain whether they did what they were supposed to do because standard procedures in hotel management demand that when a customer checks into a hotel, the name and particulars of that customer must be collected by the hotel, all of that we would investigate. “We are not leaving any stone unturned in this investigation to ensure that the crime is tied to the culprits.”
