Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on Sunday said it recorded 77 per cent rise in oil pipeline vandalism across the country in JuneÂ  2019. It disclosed this in its Monthly Financial and Operations Report for the month, adding that 106 pipeline points were breached, which increased from the 60 points vandalised in May 2019. The NNPC said the Aba-Enugu axis in the system 2E pipeline corridor accounted for 25 per cent of the total pulverised points, while the Lagos Atlas Cove-Mosimi axis of the system 2B had 23 per cent of the compromised pipeline points. It said the Ibadan-Ilorin leg of the System 2B pipeline accounted for 18 per cent of affected lines; followed by the Port Harcourt-Aba section of the system 2E, which was responsible for 13 per cent of the affected pipelines. According to the corporation, other areas accounted for the remaining 21 per cent of the cumulative line breaks. The monthly report stated that in spite of the wanton breaches of its critical pipeline network during the period, the corporation ensured continuous fuel supply and distribution across the country. It stated that during the month under review, 1.76 billion litres of petrol, translating to 58.65 million litres/day were supplied and effectively distributed. It noted that to sustain the adequate products supply and distribution in the downstream sector, the corporation had continued to monitor the daily stock of petrol across the country.
