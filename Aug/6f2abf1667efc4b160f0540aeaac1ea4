Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta The Ogun State Government said 25,000 unemployed persons registered on its job portal, five days after the portal was inaugurated. The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Dapo Abiodun, Kunle Somorin, said in a statement on Monday that the 25,000 applicants were not limited to Ogun State. Somorin said the state had begun to analyse the profiles of the applicants and would soon begin to link them with prospective employers. The statement quoted the Special Adviser to the governor, Lekan Olude, as disclosing that the portal malfunctioned at a point but it was immediately fixed following the governor’s directive. “I can confirm to you that the portal works seamlessly now and in spite of the pressure and the number of applicants, registration continues on a minute-by-minute basis. “The diversity of applications received is also overwhelming.  They cut across careers, ages and ethnic backgrounds.  People have applied from all over the country and beyond,” the statement quoted Olude to have said. Olude, who is a co-founder of Jobberman, Africa, “enjoined those who had issues registering earlier to go back online and complete their applications.” Copyright PUNCH.
