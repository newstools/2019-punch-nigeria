Ade Adesomoju, Abuja Human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), on Monday faulted the claim by the National Human Rights Commission to be blameless in the alleged illegal detention of 40 persons by the Nigerian Navy. The NHRC had in a statement by its Director Corporate Affairs and External Linkages, Lambert Oparah,  on Sunday, condemned the alleged illegal detention, but said it was not its duty to enforce the court order for the detainees’ release. It added that Falana did not show that he had approached the court to enforce the order directing the release of the detainees. It also said the Navy on its request for information, stated that the case involving the 40 persons had been handed over to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The commission was reacting to a threat of legal action against the commission in the event of the Navy’s failure to release the detainees. But Falana said in a statement on Monday that the NHRC did not furnish him with the response of the Nigerian Navy to his petition. He also wondered if the rights commission ever cross-checked with the EFCC the Navy’s claim that the detainees were sent to the anti-corruption body. He said, “I have the resent court orders to Mr. Tony Ojukwu (the Executive Secretary of NHRC), once again. “It may interest you to know that the NRHC never sent the reply of the Nigerian Navy to me. “Has NHRC confirmed the claim that the detainees were sent to EFCC? Is the NHRC  not aware that a suit has been filed against Nigeria in Zurick over the detention of 4 foreigners for 20 months by the Nigerian Navy?”
