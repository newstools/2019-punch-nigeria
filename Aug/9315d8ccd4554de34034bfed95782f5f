Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has disowned the kidnap suspect, Hamisu Wadume, saying he got no N13m from the party. Wadume had claimed in media reports that he got N13m from the APC for campaign fund during the general election but spent only N7m. But the ruling party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, on Saturday challenged him to name his sponsor, saying it would never allocate money to kidnappers and murderers.

Unlike the period when the ruling party dipped hands into the public treasury to fund political campaigns and elections, APC had to rely on its own resources. “Even if we had all the money, we would never allocate money for kidnappers and murderers. That era ended with PDP. “Perhaps, he can name whoever gave him money. Definitely, it was not APC.”
