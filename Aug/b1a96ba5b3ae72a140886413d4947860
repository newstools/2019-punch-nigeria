Samuel Awoyinfa Bankers under the auspices of Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria, Lagos branch, are set to sensitise the public to the emerging trends and the benefits of digital banking. The CIBN, according to the Lagos State Chairman, Mr Peter Ashade, will organise a forum next week with the topic: ‘Rethinking banking models in the digital age for economic development of Nigeria’. He told journalists that the topic was an instructive one for the general banking public, banking practitioners and regulators alike “as digital banking had become strategic in the heart of the economy, particularly now that the country is seeking greater financial inclusion and more efficient banking services.” He said that the fast-growing electronic banking market had thrown up major challenges in the system. The development, he added, had put the stakeholders, including financial experts in the country on their toes. He said, “Digital banking service is one of the most significant developments in the banking industry in its long history. Two of the most important features are speed and convenience. Bank customers can access their accounts, view their statements, make transfers, pay bills and more, all from the comfort of their homes, offices or on the go.” While he said that the service had come with it a number of major concerns and challenges, he lamented that there had also been perpetration of fraud which was valued in excess of $31bn as of 2018.
