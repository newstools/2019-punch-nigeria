Oladimeji Ramon Yhe Federal Government’s home-grown feeding programme will start in Lagos primary schools in September when pupils resume for another academic year. This was disclosed on Thursday by the Chairman, Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board, Dr Oluremi Sopeyin. A statement quoted Sopeyin as saying Lagos was ready to key into the FG’s programme. He urged administrators of public primary schools in Lagos State to work towards nipping all forms of social vices in pupils in the bud. According to the statement, the Lagos State Government held a meeting with administrators of public primary schools at Alausa, Ikeja ahead of September resumption. The Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folasade Adefisayo, told the head teachers to understand that their role as school administrators was critical to the shaping of the destiny of thousands of pupils in public schools and the future of the nation. Adefisayo urged them to key into government’s dream of qualitative education in the public schools, reminding them that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had pledged increased funding for education. “By your designations, pupils’ first contact and tutelage as student start with you. “You mould in academics and conduct, (and influence) the type of students that enroll for higher education and beyond. “I must confess that we have a Herculean task to perform by shaping and reshaping the destiny of millions of lives who ultimately become our pride, pride of the nation and generations to come,” the statement quoted Adefisayo to have said.
