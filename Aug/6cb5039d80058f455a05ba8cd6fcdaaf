For several hours on Thursday and early hours of Friday, thugs in their scores were said to have rendered many homeless in Odo Oba, Idi Ope, and the suburbs of Idi Arere in Ibadan South-East Local Government Area of the state. An eyewitness told PUNCH that the people of the area were subjected to palpable fears as thugs engaged in a violent clash, vandalising houses and vehicles in the affected areas. They were said to be armed to the teeth with guns, clubs and other dangerous weapons. Dotun Olalere, a resident of Odo Oba, said, “Many of the residents fled as hoodlums in a violent rivalry clash sacked many from their homes. “Many vehicles packed by their owners along the roads in the affected spots were vandalised, with many people sustaining injuries before the police arrived, hours after,” Olalere added.
