Feyisayo Popoola The Nigerian Stock Exchange has revealed plans to attract more investors to the capital market by hosting the fourth edition of its Market Data Workshop to create awareness of various product offerings. The NSE said in a statement that the event had been scheduled to hold in Lagos next month under a theme ‘Partnerships, products and the customer’. It said the 2019 Market Data Workshop would bring together investors, market data aggregators, exchanges, market regulators, government agencies, broker-dealers, media and other capital market stakeholders to discuss market data products and partnerships opportunities available to launch customer-centric products. The Divisional Head, Trading Business, NSE, Mr Jude Chiemeka, said, “We launched this event four years ago to create awareness on the critical application of market data in making sound investment decisions while highlighting the various data products available in the Nigerian marketplace. “As technology evolves, what can be considered useful data is changing. It is, for this reason, we instituted the NSE Market Data Workshop to inspire market participants and the wider ecosystem to become more innovative in the use of market data as they strive to leapfrog performance through the use of the many market data solutions offered by the NSE.” Chiemeka added that the workshop would present a high-profile business networking opportunity for market stakeholders as it had become a signature industry event due to the quality of its content, speakers, participants and publicity received since its maiden edition in 2016.
