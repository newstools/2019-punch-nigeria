Kalu said that the applicant could then pay for licence. “We have a licence for three years which costs N7,000 and the one for five years with its price as well. “After payment, the person’s information drops on FRSC portal; then, he goes for physical capturing and obtains his licence. Kalu regretted that underage driving increased during festive periods, as some teenagers would want to impress their peers. He, however, told NAN that FRSC campaigns against underage driving at churches, mosques and on radio stations was tackling the challenge. He appealed to road users to adhere to traffic rules and regulations. (NAN)
