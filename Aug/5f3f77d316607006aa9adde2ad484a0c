Enyioha Opara, Minna Some residents of Dutsen-Kura Hausa in the Bosso Local Government Area of Niger State have appealed to Governor Abubakar Bello to come to their aid by finding a lasting solution to the perennial flood in the area. The residents made the plea in separate interviews with Northern City News in Minna on Sunday. Their plea came after flood submerged no fewer than 20 houses, farmlands and destroyed several other buildings, including shops, around 3am on Saturday, while most residents were still in bed. One of the residents, Aliyu Isah said, “Three persons were carried away by the water and they have yet to be found. The government has been trying its best, but more should be done to solve this problem.” Another resident, Mohammed Idris, said, “Dutsen-Kura Hausa residents have been suffering from this problem for some time, but the government can provide palliative measures to control the flooding.” He added that while the government was being called upon to assist, residents of the area ought to play their part by ensuring that they stop the indiscriminate dumping of refuse in drainage channels.
