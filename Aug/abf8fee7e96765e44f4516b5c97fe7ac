The exercise, which is taking place across 25 states in the South-South, South-West, North-Central and North-West, is aimed at securing Nigeria’s land and maritime borders. The Armed Forces of Nigeria, the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies are providing support for the exercise, which is coordinated by the Office of the National Security Adviser. Public Relations Officer of the NCS, Joseph Attah, disclosed in a statement on Tuesday that the exercise had led to the arrest of 33 illegal immigrants. Besides the arrests, the security personnel engaged in the exercise had recorded some seizures, including 3,560 50kg bags of parboiled foreign rice, 59 bags of NPK fertilizer, 15 vehicles, 12 drums filled with Premium Motor Spirit  popularly known as petrol and three engine boats. Other items seized by the joint security outfits included 65 drums of groundnut oil, four trucks, 75 gallons of petrol, 29 motorcycles, 68 gallons of vegetable oil and 70 containers filled with petrol. Attah said the joint security team would continue to patrol the country’s borders in the concerned areas. “The overriding interest is to prevent the country against transnational security concerns such as smuggling, proliferation of small arms and light weapons, irregular migration, terrorism and armed banditry. He, however, expressed regrets over inconveniences arising from the exercise for members of the general public in communities where the programme was taking place. ”Copyright PUNCH.
