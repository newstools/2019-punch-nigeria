Adelani Adepegba, Abuja Detectives are presently questioning the founder of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, over the rape allegations levelled against him by Busola, a photographer and wife of popular singer, Timi Dakolo. Fatoyinbo is being grilled at the Force Criminal Investigation Department, Garki Area 10, Abuja. Sources confirmed that Dakolo was also being interviewed by detectives to shed more light on the alleged rape which reportedly occurred when she was a teenager. This is coming weeks after the cleric shunned an invitation extended to him by police officers probing the allegations.

The cleric in a statement last Friday, however, said he could appear before the panel after the police investigations. The PFN had disclosed on Thursday that its probe into the allegations against Fatoyinbo was inconclusive because he failed to honour the invitation to appear before the panel. But the Senior Assistant to the COZA Pastor, Ademola Adetuberu, in a statement in Abuja on Friday, disclosed that the legal advice was also premised on the statement issued and personally signed by the PFN President, Bishop Felix Omobude, “where our Pastor was publicly disowned.” When contacted, the deputy Force spokesman, Adeniran Aremu promised to find out and provide an update on the interrogations.
