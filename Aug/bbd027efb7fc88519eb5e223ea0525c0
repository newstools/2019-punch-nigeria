No fewer than 23 Nigerians are on death row in Saudi Arabia over drug-related offenses. The story was first published in April, but it seemed to have gained traction in the wake of the 78 Nigerian-born Internet scammers who were arrested mid last week in America by the Federal Bureau of investigation. According to a statement, the suspects were arrested between 2016 and 2017 at the King Abdul-Aziz International Airport, Jeddah, and Prince Muhammad Bin Abdu-Aziz International Airport, Madinah. The crime carries death penalty. See their names as published by Saudi authorities: Adeniyi Adebayo Zikri
