The National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress has again postponed the governorship primary in Bayelsa State to Tuesday and Wednesday. This is the second time the party is changing the date. It had earlier fixed Saturday, August 30, for the primary after the initial postponement from August 29. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement on Friday, said the change of date was due to a court order. “In deference to a court order, the National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress has shifted the date for the Bayelsa governorship primary till Tuesday and Wednesday, September 3 and 4, 2019,” the statement said.
