Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Command of the Nigeria Immigration Service has arrested one Oluwomise Modupe for allegedly being involved in the trafficking of one Folashade Ogunfamuyide to the Arab country of Oman. Parading the suspect at the headquarters of the NIS in Akure, the state Commander of the service, Mrs Eunice Aboyade-Yebovi, said the victim was innocently sold into slavery by the suspect. She said, “We made an arrest of the trafficker. From our findings, we understand that he has been in the business for some time. He sends the victims to an Arab country to some of his collaborators. They used the victims as slaves and he makes money out of the business. “When this particular case was reported to us, we moved into action and through our intelligence gathering, we are able to trace the victim to Oman and we arranged how she came back to Nigeria from the Arab country.” The commander said the suspect had been handed over to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons for further investigation and prosecution. “We have been doing sensitisation of our people to let them know that the victims are being sold into slavery. Some of the victims are being assaulted sexually and also face all sorts of inhuman treatment in the foreign lands,” Aboyade-Yebovi stated. However, Modupe, who admitted that he ran an agency for job placement, denied being a trafficker in persons, adding that he only assisted the victim to get job as a housemaid in the foreign land. “She (the victim) came to me to help her get a job abroad and I told her the type of job available, and she agreed to do it. I didn’t lure her into it,” the suspect stated. Copyright PUNCH.
