A baby girl who is playing DJ Cuppy’s Gelato on a keyboard has earned herself a scholarship to the highest level of education she might wish to aspire to. Billionaire oil mogul Femi Otedola uploaded the girl’s simple video on his own verified Instagram page and wrote: “My Daughter 😂😂😂 Can you find this girl? I will provide her scholarship from now through University! …F.Ote” In the video, the girl whose age is likely to be no more than five, wears a headphone and sings,”Who is your daddy, Otedola,” a line now associated with Otedola’s music star daughter, DJ Cuppy. The billionaire is impressed with the little girl’s performance and has told anyone who could locate her to do so. See the video, as uploaded on Otedola’s IG wall:
