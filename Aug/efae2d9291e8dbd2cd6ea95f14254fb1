Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has said that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration is not about to gag the media. He instead called on the Nigerian media to regulate itself. He said this during the visit of members of the Broadcasting Organisations of Nigeria to his office on Friday in Abuja. This was revealed in a statement signed by Segun Adeyemi, his Special Adviser. Mohammed said, “I have said it on many platforms that this administration is not about to gag the press. No! But we will appeal to the press to please self-regulate for the sake of this country and also for the sake of the industry itself.

I think we need to appeal to you to use your platforms for the unity and cohesion of the country,” he said. The BON delegation was led by its Acting Chairman, Sir Godfrey Ohuabunwa.
