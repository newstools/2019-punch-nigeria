The African Development Bank plans to meet with global leaders to deliberate on development initiatives for Africa. The President, AfDB, Akinwumi Adesina, would lead a delegation of the bank to join global leaders at the 7th Tokyo International Conference on African Development this week. TICAD7, hosted by Japan and co-organised by the United Nations Office of the Special Advisor on Africa, and the United Nations Development Programme, aimed at promoting high-level policy dialogue between African leaders and development partners. A statement said a major announcement was expected in support of the Enhanced Private Sector Assistance initiative, an innovative, multi-component, multi-donor framework. The initiative sought to support development to meet the infrastructure needs of Africa, with a special focus on the private sector. African leaders and key business leaders from around the world are scheduled to attend, providing an opportunity to explore investment opportunities. Copyright PUNCH.
