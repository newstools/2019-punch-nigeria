Nike Popoola A CRC score is a three-digit number ranging from 300 to 850 that summarises a person’s history of borrowing and paying back loans, CRC Credit Bureau has said. It said that the three-digit number represents how risky it is to do business with the person. It is also a credit grading system, with 300 being the lowest grade like an ‘F’ in a report card and 850 being the highest which would be an ‘A’ or distinction in his report card, the firm added. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, CRC Credit Bureau, Mr Tunde Popoola, said these in a statement made available to our correspondent. He said, “It is also used among other criteria to determine the interest rate you will be charged if a lender decides to approve the credit line or loan. “It is a numerical expression based on a level of analysis of an individual’s credit report and it is used to represent how risky it is for lenders or creditors to do business with said individual.” The CRC boss noted that in developed economies, it was a normal practice for creditors to consider credit scores and reports before advancing loans, goods or services to another party. This practice, he added, was catching up in Nigeria as there were more credit activities taking place in the financial and non-financial sectors. However, he said, a lot of Nigerians did not know that the credit scoring system existed in Nigeria. Copyright PUNCH.
