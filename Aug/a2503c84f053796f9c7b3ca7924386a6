Feyisayo Popoola Investors in the nation’s equity market lost a total of N186bn in the three trading days witnessed last week. It was a brief trading week as the market opened for three days in observance of the public holidays (Monday and Tuesday) declared by the Federal Government to mark the Eid-El-Kabir. The equity market extended its downtrend for a second consecutive week, ending the week with a 140 basis points week-on-week loss, taking its year-to-date loss to 14.33 per cent. The market capitalisation dropped to N13.12tn last week from N13.307tn recorded on Friday of the previous week. After opening the week with 82bps loss, sell-offs softened on the Nigerian Stock Exchange by Thursday before closing the week with a 47bps decline on Friday. The consumer goods sector was the worst performing sector last week, following losses in heavyweights such as Nestle Nigeria Plc and Unilever Nigeria Plc. The banking sector shed the least points amid declines in Guaranty Trust Bank Plc and Ecobank Transnational Incorporated. The industrial goods sector also closed in the red last week, held down by losses witnessed in Dangote Cement Plc and Lafarge Africa Plc. Overall, market sentiment remained weak so far in August, with the All Share Index down by 286bps month-to-date, amid unimpressive macro and global conditions. For last week, one of the largest losers was Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc while the top gainer was MTN Nigeria Communications Plc. Analysts at Vetiva Capital Management Limited said in their market review that given investors’ frail interest in the domestic bourse, they expected further declines this week. The review read in part, “With the market closing in the red on Friday, coupled with a lack of drivers to change the bearish sentiment in the market, we expect further declines in the coming week. “However, we note release of further banking earning release could direct sentiment.” The NSE said a total turnover of 726.607 million shares worth N10.459bn in 12,915 deals were traded last week by investors on the floor of the Exchange, in contrast to a total of 1.081 billion shares valued at N12.014bn that exchanged hands the previous week in 16,246 deals.
