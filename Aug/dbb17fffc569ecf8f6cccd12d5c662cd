John Charles Makurdi Two weeks after President Muhammadu Buhari approved the renaming of the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi to Joseph Sarwuan Tarka University, Makurdi, the authority of the University is yet to receive an official letter to that effect. President Buhari had given the approval to rename Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi when he signed a bill amending the law establishing the university. Two federal institutions were renamed the same day; Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi now Joseph Sawuan Tarka University, Makurdi and Nigeria Prison Service to Nigeria Correctional Service. But speaking on the new status, Head of Information Unit of Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, Mrs. Rosemary Waku, said that the authority of the University was yet to receive any correspondence to that effect.

Mrs Waku explained that President Buhari’s decision and subsequent approval on the renaming of the institution ought to be communicated officially to the Chairman-In- Council of the University, who will, in turn, pass the same to the Vice Chancellor. She said, “People are saying that the University is now a conventional University and no longer a specialized University of Agriculture. “I think our position is that we should wait until we receive official communication from the appropriate quarters via the Ministry of Education. “It is only after that, we can authoritatively speak on our new status. We are hoping that by next week, if they are doing what they suppose to do, we will have that official communication. “We will not want to speak on a subject, we don’t know (about)”, Mrs Waku said.
