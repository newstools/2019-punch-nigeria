The Ghanaian National Security Operatives have arrested one Don Ofori Donny, a Nigerian, who was attempting to fraudulently acquire a Ghanaian passport. Myjoyonline reports that Donny would have obtained the Ghanaian passport but for the timely arrival of the operatives. It was also reported that he had fraudulently in the past obtained a Ghanaian birth certificate and a voter identification card. When asked why he needed the passport, he said ‘he wanted to belong’. “I am a Nigerian who has been based in Ghana for a long time…I have been part of the people and I made myself part of the people so I decided to do everything [the people do],” he told Myjoyonline. Investigation is still ongoing.
