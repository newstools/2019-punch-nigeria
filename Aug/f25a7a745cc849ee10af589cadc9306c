Oladimeji Ramon The Lagos State Governor has said its integrated 32 metric tonne-capacity rice mill at Imota will be completed in the next seven months. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Gbolahan Lawal, said upon inauguration the mill would be the biggest in West Africa and would not only guarantee steady rice supply to consumers but also create employment and wealth. Lawal spoke during an inspection tour of the facility on Thursday, according to a statement. He was accompanied by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Agriculture, Ms. Abisola Olusanya, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Dr Olayiwole Onasanya, and other top officials of the agric ministry. He expressed satisfaction at the progress of work on the mill. Lawal noted that though the mill would cater to the rice need of a substantial percentage of Lagosians, the quantity of rice being consumed in Lagos was far in excess of 32 metric tonnes. According to him, the rice consumption rate of an average person in this part of the world hovers between 32 and 40 kilogrammes, “which explains why the Lagos State Government is collaborating with the South West and Northern States as well as the Rice Farmers Association for the supply of rice paddy.” The commissioner said, “The 2017/2018 report from the Rice Farmers Association shows that they have the capacity to produce 10 million tonnes of rice but that as at today only two million is being utilised with 30 integrated rice mills that is available currently, leaving a shortfall of eight million, but going forward I see opportunities, I see jobs, I see wealth being created and see better nutrition.” Copyright PUNCH.
