EDWARD NNACHI The Governor of Ebonyi State, Mr Dave Umahi, has commenced the construction of 150-metre road, off Nkaliki road in the Abakaliki Local Government Area of the state. The Redeemed Christian Church of God (Gate of Heaven Parish) is located on the road. Umahi, who had consistently intervened on the construction of roads leading to any church in the state where government projects were taking place, added that the idea was to ensure Christians worship God without grumbling in the state. It was learnt that the idea behind constructing the road came about the very day the governor attended a wedding in the church but met gridlock on his way. Commencing the project, Umahi, who was represented by his Senior Special Assistant on Infrastructure Maintenance, Ali Odefa, said some culverts would also be constructed on the road to ensure ease of movement by people on Sundays. The Pastor in charge of the church, Amari Omaka (SAN), said the road was in a very pitiable state until the government decided to fix it. He added that the church members did not pass it to access the church whenever it rained. Copyright PUNCH.
