Godwin Isenyo Abductors of the Senior Pastor of the Nagarta Baptist Church, Makere, Kaduna State, were said to have reduced the N20m ransom to N7m. Pastor Elisha Numan and his son, Emmanuel, were on Wednesday reportedly abducted by heavily armed men at their residence. The son was later released as a negotiating contact. The abductors called the family through Emmanuel to demand N20m ransom after they had threatened the pastor’s son to raise the money or had his father killed within three days. The Christian Association of Nigeria in Kaduna State confirmed the abduction of the pastor. But on Saturday, the Kaduna CAN’s Chairman, Rev. Joseph Hayab, told our correspondent that the N20m initially demanded by the abductors had been reduced to N7m and that negotiation was still on. “They have now asked for N7m but we are still negotiating,” he said. Hayab described the incident as sad, noting that the association trusted in God that all would be well. “It is sad but we are trusting God it will be well,” the cleric added.

Omolewa was killed by his abductors and the wife kidnapped while the son escaped. The kidnappers demanded N50m ransom to release the pastor’s wife. She, however, regained her freedom after reportedly paying N3m ransom. Copyright PUNCH.
