Ted Odogwu Operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Kano Police Command have arrested 15 bandits terrorising residents of the Jaen Quarters in the state. Speaking to journalists, the state Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Iliyasu, identified the arrested suspects as Nasiru Ibrahim, Usman Abubakar and Halifa Mohammed. Others were Nasiru Sani, Yusuf Dauda, Umar Abdulsalam, Umar Abubakar and Ibrahim Rabiu, Murtala Abubakar, Mohammed Rufai, Ibrahim Bala, Mohd Yahaya, Bashir Mohd, Sani Inusa and Abdulrahman Yusuf. The CP said the suspects had for some time converted the Jaen Quarters to their hideout, where they often smoked weed before embarking on their criminal activities. Iliyasu also said operatives of the command arrested one Isyaku Maude, a member of a notorious armed robbery syndicate, while on surveillance patrol along the Obasanjo Road in Kano. Stating that the suspects were undergoing investigation, the CP said various weapons including locally- made pistols, double-edged swords, cutlasses and axes were recovered from the bandit. “The suspect confessed to have attacked a warehouse behind the Bank of the North headquarters, along the Zaria Road, Kano, and carted away valuable goods,” Iliyasu said. The CP added that members of the Operation Puff Adder arrested an armed robber, from whom some cars were recovered. Copyright PUNCH.
