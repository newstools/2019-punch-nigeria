Anna Okon The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency says its Command, Control, Computer Communication and Information Centre, otherwise known as the C4i Centre has begun operations on a 24-hour basis. It said that the centre located at the NIMASA Maritime Resource Development Facility in Kirikiri, Lagos, would serve as the command and control centre for the Deep Blue project – a multi-pronged approach towards tackling insecurity in Nigeria’s territorial waters and the entire Gulf of Guinea. According to the agency, the C4i centre is where tactical and strategic decisions for the operational workflow of all the platforms of the project will emanate from. It quoted the Director General of NIMASA, Dr Dakuku Peterside, as saying that the centre was in line with the Federal Government’s Deep Blue project initiative geared towards the realisation of a safe and secure maritime domain in Nigeria. To realise this initiative, the agency had trained some personnel, including staff members of NIMASA who would man the control centre, Peterside added. Copyright PUNCH.
