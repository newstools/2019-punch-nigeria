Since the inception of this administration, I don’t think we have defaulted. “We have a very few Local Government Areas that we augment especially Chanchaga, Bida, Suleja, Kontagora, Mokwa, Paikoro, Shiroro, Lavun, Lapai, Agaie, Paikoro, Rijau, and Tafa. It is not that this can not be surmounted. “Sometimes we have high and or low inflow of allocation. But on the average, we augment for these Local Government Areas within the range of between N500 million and N600 million monthly. And we do take overdraft to overcome these obstacles.” A few weeks ago, the Chairman, NULGE in the state, Abdulkareem Lafene had said, “The direct allocation policy is already being implemented and has achieved close to 90 per cent success in the state.”
