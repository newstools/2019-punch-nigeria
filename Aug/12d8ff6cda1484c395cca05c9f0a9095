Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti A middle-aged woman and a mother of three, Mrs Bukola Olarenwaju, was allegedly raped and strangled at the Olorunda area of Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital on Thursday. Accusing fingers have been pointed at a neighbour of the deceased, whose belonging was said to have been found at the scene of the killing, even as he had disappeared since the incident happened. Sources said the husband of the woman had gone to work while her children were away at holiday classes leaving her alone at home when the incident occurred. The perpetrator was said to have broken into the woman’s room where he raped her and killed her in the process. Sources said one of the children of the deceased saw the neighbour on a bike while returning from school on Thursday but was unsuspecting of any occurrence at home at that moment.

We are yet to arrest the man, but proper security arrangements have been made that would ensure speedy arrest of the suspect”. Ikechukwu said the deceased’s husband had deposited the corpse at EKSUTH morgue while investigation was ongoing on the matter.
