President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday commiserated with Aliko Dangote, Africa’s leading industrialist and businessman, following recent losses of some members of his family. The President’s condolence message was communicated via a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in Abuja. The Dangote extended family lost three persons — Aliko’s cousin, Madugu Dantata; his uncle, Murtala Dantata; and another relation, Sa’idu Fanta. The message of condolence to Dangote, the Dantata family and the government and people of Kano State was related through Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation. Buhari described the losses, which occurred in rapid succession, as irreparable losses that must be accepted as God-ordained. He prayed to Allah to grant peace for the departed souls and the bereaved families the strength to bear the losses. (NAN)
