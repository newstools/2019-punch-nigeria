Speaker of New Zealand’s Parliament, Trevor Mallard, sent the Internet into a meltdown on Wednesday when he tweeted the photograph of himself bottle-feeding a legislator’s baby while presiding over the day’s proceedings. Father of the baby is MP Tāmati Coffey, who represents Waiariki, a New Zealand parliamentary Māori electorate that was first established for the 1999 election. Coffey had brought his baby to the parliament after coming back from paternity leave, and the Speaker had volunteered to babysit for him when he was engaged in a debate on the floor of the parliament. The Speaker introduced the photographed on Wednesday via a tweet on his verified Twitter handle @SpeakerTrevor. He had tweeted, “Normally, the Speaker’s chair is only used by presiding officers, but today, a VIP took the chair with me. “Congratulations, @tamaticoffey and Tim on the newest member of your family.” The photograph has received over 1,900 retweets and over 8,900 likes.
