Hindi Livinus Doctors at the Federal Medical Centre Yola, Adamawa State,  are battling to save the life of a  five-year-old girl reportedly raped by a man, whose identity is still unknown. Doctors at the hospital said the development had caused severe damage to the girl’s rectum and womb. Dr Sexana, a paediatrician, at the hospital, who first attended to the girl when she was brought in a  distressed state, said a minor surgery was carried out to stabilise her. He added that a major corrective surgery must be carried out by paediatric consultants to save the girl’s life. According to sources, when the girl was rushed to the hospital after she was found in a pool of blood it took the intervention of three specialist doctors at the emergency and intensive care unit to revive her. Mrs Rebecca Kwabe, one of the  female lead United Nations’ women mentors in the state, said, “The girl’s condition still remains critical.” She called for help to save the girl’s life. Kwabe confirmed she had been informed by Dr Sexana that the girl had been operated upon, but needed a major corrective surgery.
