Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna The Kaduna State Police Command on Friday confirmed the abduction of a member of the Kaduna State House of Assembly, Suleiman Dabo, by gunmen. Dabo, who represents Zaria constituency in the Assembly, was said to have been kidnapped at Farakwe village along the Kaduna-Zaria Expressway on Thursday. The incident occurred 48 hours after the abduction of seven persons, including three final year law students of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.  However, reports claimed the families of the students paid a ransom of N5.5m before the students regained their freedom. But the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Yakubu Sabo, said the command received the report of the lawmaker’s abduction through the divisional police officer of Marraraban Jos, also in Kaduna State, in the early hours of Friday. Sabo, in a statement, said, “On August 30, 2019, at about 0030hrs, the command received information through the DPO, Mararraban Jos, that a Toyota Camry, with Reg No. ZAR 972 TL, was found parked without occupants at a point near Farakwai village, along the Kaduna-Zaria Expressway. “Patrol teams were immediately dispatched to the area and they recovered the vehicle.
