Olaide Oyelude,Katsina The Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps, Brig Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, has said  the NYSC will  not pay  any ransom  for the release of  any  kidnapped corps member. He advised corps members to be security conscious and be mindful of their movements. Ibrahim  also advised them to cultivate the habit of going  to bed at 6pm. The military officer  said these   on Sunday when he made an  unannounced visit to the NYSC orientation camp in Katsina. It was the DG’s second   visit to the camp following the death of three corps members serving in the state in a road crash. “The NYSC will never pay ransom if any corps member is kidnapped. Corps members are therefore advised to secure themselves as much as possible to avoid being kidnapped,” Ibrahim was quoted as saying in a statement by spokesman for the NYSC in  Katsina  State. He warned them  to always obtain permission  before travelling out of their areas. Copyright PUNCH.
