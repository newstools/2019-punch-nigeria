British Airways pilots on Friday said they will strike for three days in September in a dispute over pay, in a move that could affect tens of thousands of travellers. The strikes on September 9, 10 and 27 were announced by the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), which said there had been a 93-per cent vote in favour of industrial action. “It is completely unacceptable that Balpa is destroying the travel plans of tens of thousands of our customers with this unjustifiable strike action,” said the airline. “We are extremely sorry that after many months of negotiations, based on a very fair offer, Balpa has decided on this reckless course of action,” it said.

Balpa said the strikes were “a last resort” but added that pilots had made “sacrifice after sacrifice” in recent years. Balpa estimated each day of strike action would cost the company around £40 million (44 million euros, $49 million). (AFP)
