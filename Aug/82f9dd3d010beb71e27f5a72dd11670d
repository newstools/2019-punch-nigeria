Olaleye Aluko Operatives of the National Agency for the Prohibition in Trafficking in Persons have arrested three Nigerians, Chika Nnodim, Samuel Udoetuk and John Oji for allegedly trafficking three Ghanaians from Ghana to Nigeria. The three suspects were nabbed after the case was reported to the agency by the Ghana High Commission, Abuja in April 2019, which raised the alarm over the kidnapping of three Ghanaian girls aged between 15 and 21 to Nigeria. The suspects were believed to be part of a criminal border syndicate and were handed over to the office of the Inspector-General of Police for further investigation after their arrest by NAPTIP. The agency said in a release on Saturday that the suspects had been under “security watch list of the governments of Nigeria and Ghana and were nabbed by NAPTIP officials after a very painstaking investigation at various locations within Nigeria and Ghana.” The agency’s Head of Public Relations and Information, Stella Nezan, said, “The case was reported to the agency by the Ghana High Commission Abuja in April 2019 alleging the kidnap of their citizens from Ghana to Nigeria. The agency collaborated with relevant law enforcement agencies within Nigeria and Ghana during the investigation.” The Director-General, NAPTIP Julie Okah-Donli, said the agency and the police would ensure diligent prosecution of the suspects.
