Johnny Edward Samson Siasia has been fined $50,000 and banned for life by FIFA for agreeing to ‘the manipulation of matches’ for betting purposes. The former Super Eagles coach’s ban emanated from an extensive investigation into matches that Wilson Perumal attempted to fix. In a statement from FIFA’s independent Ethics Committee, “Siasia was found guilty of having accepted that he would receive bribes in relation to the manipulation of matches that Perumal attempted to manipulate for betting purposes.” Siasia’s action breaches art. 11 (Bribery) of 2009 edition of the FIFA Code of Ethics and banned him for life from all football-related activities (administrative, sports or any other) at both national and international levels. The former Nigeria forward becomes the third African to be banned by FIFA for his links to Perumal after former Sierra Leone FA official Abu Kabba and former Botswana FA official Mooketsi Kgotlele were suspended in July for five years and for life respectively. Meanwhile Siasia has vowed to clear his name from the embarrassing report. “Forget that report,” Siasia reacted angrily when Saturday Punch sought to hear from him on the ban. “I’m tired of everyone asking me on this report. I don’t know anything about this. I did nothing wrong and I have not received any letter from FIFA and I will fight this to clear my name. Copyright PUNCH.
