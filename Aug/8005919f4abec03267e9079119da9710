“This is the biggest site where the remains of sacrificed children have been found,” chief archaeologist Feren Castillo told AFP on Tuesday. Castillo said the children, who were aged between four and 14, were sacrificed in a ritual to honour the Chimu culture’s gods.

He added that there may still be more to be found. “It’s uncontrollable, this thing with the children. Wherever you dig, there’s another one,” Castillo said. The children’s remains were found in a position facing the sea. Some still had skin and hair. Pampa la Cruz is a short distance from Huanchaquito, where the remains of 140 sacrificed children and 200 llamas were found in April 2018. The Chimu civilization extended along the Peruvian coast to Ecuador but disappeared in 1475 after it was conquered by the Inca empire. (AFP)
