Sola Shittu A black market petrol trader at Igbogor in the Ovia South West local Government Area of Edo State, Mary Agada, has been burnt to death by a petrol explosion in her home. There were conflicting reports about the cause of the fire which also left the victim’s wooden home destroyed. Eyewitness account said the 20-year-old woman was with her husband, Amend Agada, in the kitchen when the incident happened. The husband, however, escaped death by the whisker as he jumped out of the house. “She kept fuel in her kitchen and was selling to a customer when it attracted fire from a nearby stove in the kitchen,” a neighbour, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. “Her body was later removed from the rubbles after the fire had been put out. She was burnt beyond recognition,” he added. The Edo State Police Command spokesperson, DSP Chidi Nwabuzor, said he had yet to be briefed on the incident. Copyright PUNCH.
