’Femi Asu Proven natural gas reserves in the country have risen to 203 trillion cubic feet following the new discovery made by Eni, an Italian oil major. Nigeria has the largest gas reserves in Africa and the ninth largest in the world but only about 25 per cent of the reserves is being produced. The country has around 202 Tcf of proven gas reserves – a number that was increased from around 187 Tcf late last year – plus about 600 Tcf of unproven gas reserves. Eni said on Tuesday that through its affiliate, Nigerian Agip Oil Company, it made a significant gas and condensate find in the deeper sequences of the Obiafu-Obrikom fields, in Oil Mining Lease 61. It said the Obiafu-41 deep well had reached a total depth of 4.374 m, encountering an important gas and condensate accumulation within the deltaic sequence of Oligocene age comprising more than 130m of high quality hydrocarbon-bearing sands. “The find amounts to about one trillion cubic feet of gas and 60 million barrels of associated condensate in the deep drilled sequences,” Eni said in a statement. According to the Italian firm, the discovery has further potential that will be assessed with the next appraisal campaign. It said, “The well can deliver in excess of 100 million standard cubic feet/day of gas and 3,000 barrels/day of associated condensates, and will be immediately put on-stream to increase NAOC’s gas production. “The discovery is part of a drilling campaign planned by NAOC JV and aimed at exploring near-field and deep pool opportunities as immediate time to market opportunities.” In 2018, Eni’s equity hydrocarbon production amounted to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, it added.
