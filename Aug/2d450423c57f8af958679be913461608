Privileged Nigerians paid President Muhammadu Buhari homage on Sallah Day. They consisted of ex-governor, senator, minister-designate, in-laws, accountant-general, accomplished women, and others. However, three of the President’s children — Yusuf, Hanan and Amina — prepped up dad before he started receiving his visitors. The President seemed to enjoy it as he smiled broadly at his children! Their mother, First Lady Aisha, is currently in Mecca for the holy pilgrimage. See the photographs, courtesy, Buhari Sallau, via Instagram:
