A 14-year-old JSS 111 pupil in Enugu State has confessed to the police that she was never kidnapped but willingly left home to see her boyfriend contrary to the alarm raised by the parents that she had been kidnapped. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Ebere Amaraizu, said this in a statement on Saturday in Enugu. He described as false the kidnap alarm raised by Mr Frank Anioma, over his daughter, Miss Kosisochukwu Anioma. He said that Anioma took to the social media to announce his daughter’s kidnap as well as reported to the police. Amaraizu said that the fake kidnap alarm was raised on Aug. 22 and the police operatives of the Anti-Kidnap Unit immediately swung into action. He said that contrary to the fake social media hype, fresh facts had emerged on the purported fake kidnapping incident. According to him, Kosisochukwu was never abducted by anyone and that she willingly left their home. He said that Anioma’s daughter went to the park at Holy Ghost without telling anyone and headed to Owerri where she met her boyfriend. “According to her, both of them have been secondary school friends at Abakiliki but she needed to go see him following the prolonged school holiday. “Kosisochukwu, 14, is going to SSS 1 if school reopens same with her boyfriend who hails from Owerri in Imo State,’’ the police spokesman said. Amaraizu said that Kosisochukwu confessed that she was not abducted nor kidnapped as stated by her father. (NAN)
