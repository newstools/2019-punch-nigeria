Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has disproved the insinuations that Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, ordered the probe of Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Mrs. Winifred Oyo-Ita. The EFCC said in a statement by its spokesman, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, that the investigation was based on evidence and not on political considerations. There had been rumours that Oyo-Ita came under probe because of the disagreement she had with Kyari during the Abdulrasheed Maina saga. However, the EFCC said that, as an independent government agency, it would not go after individuals based on politics. The statement reads in part, “The attention of the EFCC has been drawn to reports by a section of the media insinuating that the ongoing investigation of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Mrs. Winifred Oyo-Ita, by the Commission was instigated by the Chief of Staff to the President. “The Commission wishes to state that there is no truth in these claims, and urges the general public to disregard the reports as the handiwork of mischief makers. “For the avoidance of doubt, investigation by the EFCC is evidence-based. Most often, they are triggered by petitions or intelligence. “In the case of the HoS Oyo-Ita’s investigation, it was prompted by intelligence received by the Commission.” The agency appealed to the media to be circumspect in reportage and not lend themselves to actions that could befuddle its activities.
