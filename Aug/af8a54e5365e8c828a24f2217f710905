Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The National Chairman of the All Progressives Committee, Adams Oshiomhole, said the party had become wiser from court’s judgements which disqualified its candidates in the past. Oshiomhole spoke during the inauguration of the Governorship Screening Committees for the APC aspirants for the August 29  Kogi and Bayelsa state primaries. Senator Hope Uzodinma is heading the Kogi screening committee, while Senator Abdullahi Gumel is heading that of Bayelsa. Oshiomhole said, “Many put it that screening is a formality but because of our own peculiarity, people are sometimes economical with the truth. We need to do proper screening and ensure that those who pass the screening are likely to be able to stand the chances not only of winning election but of not being challenged after. “We have a couple of cases where people claimed what they didn’t have or they swore to affidavits such that they have two, three ages depending on what purpose they are swearing affidavit for.” Oshiomhole urged the committees to observe contradiction in aspirants claims and examine issues raised against them without sentiment or partiality. “If we allow someone who is clearly ineligible to contest election, there will be another road block. Our opponent can point out those contradictions and in the end our party candidature might be in jeopardy,”  he said. Oshiomhole said the screening of the aspirants should take place at the states party secretariats in Lokoja and Yenagoa, urging the committees to discharge their duties without fear or favour and to be fair to all.
