Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government has a target of constructing one million houses annually in order to reduce about 17 million housing deficit in Nigeria. It disclosed this through the Minister of State for Works and Housing, Abubakar Aliyu, during his inspection of the Federal Housing Authority’s mass housing project in Zuba, a suburb of Abuja. Aliyu noted that by constructing one million houses annually, the government would be able to bridge the housing gap in Nigeria by 2033. He said, “The production now is low; we are constructing 100,000 houses per year and we hope to improve it by constructing one million houses per year in order to close the gap of 17 million to 20 million housing deficits by the year 2033. That is the target of government.” On how to achieve this, the minister said the government would attract investors into the sector to help solve the problem of housing deficit. He explained that the FHA project in Zuba was designed specifically to address the huge housing deficit for the medium and low-income earners. According to him, the project would have been completed in August if not for the rains, adding that it would be delivered soon. Aliyu said, “We will ensure that the project is completed soon, because it is part of our primary focus. That is why it is our first point of call after inauguration.” Copyright PUNCH.
