The Nigeria Customs Service has given back 80 per cent of the licences of clearing agents seized on suspicion of fraud and impersonation. The National President, Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents, Tony Nwabunike, made this known recently. In June, 300 licenses belonging to members of the ANLCA, including that of Nwabunike, were suspended by the NCS. The NCS alleged that the licences were being hacked and used to smuggle vehicles out of the port. Nwabunike said the association was working hard to ensure that licences belonging to the rest of the members of the association were released as well. “This time around, the CG is interacting with us and he is doing well. The issue is very clear; the problems at the port are very enormous and we are taking them one after the other,” he was quoted by Daily Trend as saying. He added, “Almost 80 per cent of our seized licences have been released and I am very sure that the Comptroller-General of Customs after scrutinising the remaining ones will release them. “In the areas of our relationship with Customs, it is becoming more cordial.
