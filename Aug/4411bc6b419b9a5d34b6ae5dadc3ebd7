No matter the grievances of the killers of Rev. Fr. Tanko, they have gone too far. This is one death too many. “This is a period of sober reflection for us in Taraba and all people of good conscience. We must use this period to think out the possible way to tackle this growing insecurity in our land,” the statement read. The Tiv group prayed for the repose of the soul of Rev. Fr. Tanko and appealed to the public to avoid stereotyping any group and pre-emptying the outcome of investigation, saying that doing so, will narrow the scope of investigation. The statement also called on the people of Taraba especially those in the area where the incident happened to support security agencies to do their work professionally to bring the killers to justice. Rev. Fr. Tanko was reportedly killed between Kasuan Haske and Tor-Tsee village on his way to his station at Amadu from Takum on Wednesday.
