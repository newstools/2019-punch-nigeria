Tunde Oyekola Kwara State governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq has said that his administration is planning to replicate the Federal Government’s social investment programmes to fight poverty and youth unemployment in the state. To achieve this, the governor said a bill to replicate the anti-poverty social investment programmes in the state would be sent to the state House of Assembly in the coming days to give legal teeth to the policy. A statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Rafiu Ajakaye,   said that AbdulRazaq disclosed this on Monday when he visited the Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute at Jimba-Oja, in Ifelodun Local Government Area of the state. The governor added that the legislation would domesticate the FG’s  TraderMoni and school feeding programmes for the benefit of the poor. “The thrust of the administration is to lift our people from poverty line and how to go about itis through agriculture. We have a goldmine in ARMTI and we will take full advantage of its resources. “Empowerment must be from the communities and I can assure you that we’ll engage you because this week or so, we are sending a Bill to the state House of Assembly to replicate the federal government’s social investment programme in Kwara.” He said the administration would also key into the Village Alive Development Initiatives of AMRTI to empower Kwara youths and deepen participation in agriculture.
