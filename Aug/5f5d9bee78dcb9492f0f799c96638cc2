Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The Chief Executive Officer, 1860 Travels, Mr Francis Daodu, has said Tours2china, a new initiative designed to promote in-bound and out-bound travel between Nigeria and China, will boost tourism. According to him, Tours2china is a new brand which offers a group of five Nigerians, willing to travel together at the same time, an easy opportunity to get group visa which affords them the opportunity to tour various cities in China and do business there at the same time. He said it was initiated by a Chinese travel agency, Bravo International Travel Tours, and an indigenous travel agency, 1860 Travels. Daodu told journalists that the exchange of culture between Nigeria and China was a must-happen thing through the platform, thereby aiding development in all facets. He said, “We are going to be experiencing both out-bound and in-bound travel. So, it is not just going to be Nigerians going to China. This brand has created a platform for Chinese to visit Africa generally and Nigeria specifically. “There is no partnership that leaves out its people. What this is going to achieve is the exchange of culture. This is the best of cultural exchange between China and Nigeria. During the Yuletide period, we will be expecting quite a lot of Chinese to visit Nigeria.” He, however, noted that a refundable fee would be charged in order to prevent absconding. “We don’t want this platform to abruptly come to an end in the name of absconding. It is expected that this will be a legitimate means for those who want to travel to China for leisure or personal business,” Daodu said. He explained that the brand had put together a package for those who also wished to travel to China for personal reasons. Copyright PUNCH.
