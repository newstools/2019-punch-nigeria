Friday Olokor, Abuja Indigenes of oil-producing communities in the Niger Delta on Thursday took to the streets of Abuja to protest against the refusal of Shell Petroleum Development Company to comply with the Senate resolution that they should be paid N6.9bn. The protesters displayed placards and banners with different inscriptions to ventilate their grievances to the relevant authorities. They issued a two-week ultimatum to the SPDC to meet their demand. The indigenes converged on the Unity Fountain in Abuja where they threatened to destroy the assets of the SPDC in the Niger Delta region if the amount was not released to the affected communities. The leader of the communities and Chief of Opolo community in Bayelsa State, Chief Odede Hezekiah, said they could have mobilised the people of the area to go after the SPDC’s facilities to express their grievances but settled for a protest in Abuja to draw the attention of President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigerians to the issue. He said, “We are giving them just two weeks from now, if they don’t respect the Senate resolution, anything can happen. “We just want the President of Nigeria to hear everything before we take our action. We give them just two weeks from now, if they don’t respect the Senate resolution, anything can happen.” Another speaker, Ayigba Shedrack, representing Azagbene community of Bayelsa State, said the Senate had passed a resolution directing that the SPDC to pay N600,000 per hectare of land per annum to host communities in the Niger Delta. He said, “But as I am talking to you now, they paid us N200,000.” Copyright PUNCH.
