The case of 78 Nigerian-born men who were indicted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation mid last week has led to angry debates and taking sides among Nigerians on the social media. It may be recalled that Igbo names featured prominently on the FBI charge sheet relating the criminal activities of some 80 persons indicted in one of the massive Internet scams in American history.

The table turned on Sunday morning as an April 2019 list of convicted drug dealers resurfaced in the media. The four-month-old report had revealed that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was set to execute 23 Nigerians who were arrested  for drug offences as far back as 2017. While the names on the FBI list were mostly Igbo, those on the Saudi list were mostly Yoruba, with a sprinkle of wholly Muslim names which some suspected to be Hausa.
