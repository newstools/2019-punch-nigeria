Sahara Group has said it remained resolute in its decision to contribute to the growth and development of South Sudan’s economy through investment in the country’s oil and power sectors. The Executive Director, Sahara Group, Tope Shonubi, said this during a courtesy call on South Sudan’s President, Salva Mayardit, at the State House on Wednesday in Juba, according to a statement. He said Sahara Group was firmly behind the administration’s policy requiring all local and foreign investors to align with the nation’s good governance protocol in all sectors of the economy. He said, “Sahara Group has a track record of good governance that is widely acclaimed across various markets where we operate in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. We are behind full compliance with all governance requirements in South Sudan. “In fact, we are here to join hands with the good people of South Sudan under the leadership of President Kiir to ensure sustained economic development in the nation.” Shonubi said Sahara Group would contribute to projects designed to enhance sustainable development in South Sudan through the Sahara Foundation, which he said had since upgraded the computer centre at the University of Juba with modern equipment.
