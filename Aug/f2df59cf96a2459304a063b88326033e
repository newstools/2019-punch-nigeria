Ademola Babalola, Ibadan A leader  of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in Oyo State, Alhaji Mukaila Lamidi, popularly known as Auxiliary,  has urged states to collaborate with the NURTW  to tackle  kidnapping  and insurgency. Lamidi,  who addressed journalists on Tuesday in Ibadan, lamented a spate of kidnapping and insurgency in the country. He said, “If government’s fight against  kidnapping and robbery in the South and insurgency  in the North will yield good results, state governments need to collaborate with the NURTW. “For instance, in Oyo State, our union is finalising  arrangements to install 4G telecommunication gadgets in our parks  and vehicles. “We are in talks with some professionals and consultants,  both here and abroad and we shall employ over 500 of computer/information technology and transport management graduates for this purpose. “Our union is ready to join forces  with the  Oyo  State Government to flush  criminals out  of the state and make it habitable  for  everyone.” Auxiliary urged  parents to discourage their children from being involved in  criminal activities. He said, “Some people without tangible or traceable sources of wealth are gathering gullible boys for self- interest against the state government and the union. Copyright PUNCH.
