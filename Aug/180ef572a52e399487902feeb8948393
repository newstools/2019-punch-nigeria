Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja The Presidential Initiative on Continuous Audit in the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, has begun a weeklong mop up verification exercise for ex-workers of the former Nigeria Airways, who were not audited during the previous exercise. A similar exercise was conducted in the six geo-political zones in September 2018. The latest verification exercise is holding simultaneously in Lagos and Kano and is meant to ensure that all eligible beneficiaries were audited and paid their entitlements. Speaking while on an inspection visit at the two centres, the Permanent Secretary, Special Duties in the ministry, Dr Mohammed Dikwa, represented by the Deputy Director Procurement, Mr Izerebu John, stated that the exercise was in line with the Federal Government’s resolve to pay all former workers of the defunct airways their benefits. The Permanent Secretary assured the ex-workers at the two centres that the Federal Government was committed to paying their dues once they were audited. He advised them to cooperate with the verifiers and ensure that they provided all the documents required for the exercise. ”Copyright PUNCH.
