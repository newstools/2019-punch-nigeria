Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Police Command, on Monday, said it would arraign a soldier on Wednesday for allegedly raping a student of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko. The suspect, Lance Corporal Sunday Adelola, had two weeks ago allegedly raped a 300-level student of the Department of Religious and African Studies, AAUA, at a military checkpoint on the Ikare Akoko-Akungba Akoko Road. It was gathered that Adelola had been dismissed by the Nigerian Army before he was handed over to the police for prosecution. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Femi Joseph, told our correspondent that the suspect would be charged this week. “We are taking the suspect to court on Wednesday; and if we don’t take him to court on Wednesday, we will certainly take him to court on Thursday,” he stated. Joseph denied the allegation that the army and the police wanted to sweep the matter under the carpet,, saying justice would take its course in the matter. Meanwhile, the Women for Advancement Group, Ondo State chapter, has commended the army for dismissing the randy soldier. The state Coordinator of the group, Mrs Kemi Kamar, urged the police to ensure that the suspect is brought to justice. She said in a statement, “Now that the case is with the police, we want to appeal to the police to do a proper investigation and chargethe suspect to court without any delay. “This will serve as a deterrent to others, who think they are above the law.” Copyright PUNCH.
