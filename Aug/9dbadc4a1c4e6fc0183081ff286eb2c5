The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Defence, Senator Aliyu Wamakko, says the fumigation exercise he sponsored to eradicate mosquitoes in Sokoto metropolis was conceived in the best interest of his constituents. Wamakko (APC-Sokoto), made the clarification to newsmen in a statement signed by Bashir Mani, his Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, in Sokoto on Friday. He said, “As a duly and constitutionally elected representative of the people of the district, I will not conceive any programme that will be detrimental to them. “The exercise is, therefore, aimed at complementing the efforts of the state government to further alleviate the suffering of the teeming populace in the district.” The lawmaker added that the fumigation exercise was also well intentioned and aimed to drastically reduce the malaria scourge occasioned by mosquitoes. “The exercise poses no danger to the intended beneficiaries who were too elated and excited about the anti-mosquitoes spray. “I am however of the strong belief that the state government would not insist on its stoppage; but if it does, the exercise will be immediately halted,” Wamakko said. News Agency of Nigeria reports that the Sokoto state government in a statement by its Malaria Elimination Agency, had, on Thursday, stopped Wamakko’s fumigation exercise. According to the government, the fumigation exercise is not sanctioned, as all agencies in charge of healthcare in the state are unaware of the exercise.  (NAN)
