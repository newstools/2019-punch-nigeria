Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti A 32-year-old man, Ojo Owoeye, was on Friday, arraigned before an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court for molesting and impregnating a 16-year-old secondary school pupil. Owoeye was charged with one count of sexual abuse. The police prosecutor, Inspector Johnson Okunade, alleged that the defendant committed the offence sometime in May in Ado-Ekiti, where he sexually abused and impregnated the pupil. “The offence contravenes Section 4 of the Ekiti State Gender-based Violence (Prohibition) Law, 2011,” Okunade stated. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The defence counsel, Mr Ojo Abioye, told the court that his client would take responsibility for the pregnancy and prayed the court to grant him bail.
