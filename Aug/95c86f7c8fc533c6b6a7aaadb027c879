Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari and the newly-inaugurated ministers, urging them to consolidate on previous achievements of the government. The party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, said it noted with utmost satisfaction the painstaking efforts of the president in picking the new ministers, their speedy screening and confirmation by the Senate. This, it said, was in addition to their rigorous induction to acquaint them with the onerous task of assisting the President in repositioning the economy, ensuring the security of lives and property and fighting corruption. APC said, “While the APC-led administration has recorded remarkable milestones in these three areas, we align with the position of the President that there is more work to be done.

To state a few, the APC-led government has an urgent task to lift Nigerians out of poverty, secure lives and property, grow our economy, build infrastructure, bring back discipline to our private and public conducts and mobilize Nigerians through personal examples towards evolving a Nigeria we all can be proud of. “We, therefore, urge the new ministers to justify the confidence reposed in them by the President and, indeed, all Nigerians, by settling down to work quickly and hit the ground running and consolidate on the progress that has been made in the various sectors. “We join the President in calling on the newly-inaugurated ministers to ensure teamwork amongst themselves so as to create harmony in the governance system. This is the only way we can achieve synergy in our policy implementation and overall implementation of our Next Level manifesto for the country.”
