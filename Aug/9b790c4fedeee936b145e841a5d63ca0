Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo No fewer than seven people have been killed and eleven villages burnt in the ongoing Jukun-Tiv crisis in the Takum local government area of Taraba State. Takum is the hometown of Governor Darius Ishaku and retired Gen. TY Danjuma. The latest attack on Ikyergba village near Takum on Saturday happened while the governor was holding a meeting with Tiv stakeholders at the Exco Chambers of the Taraba Government House in Jalingo. An eyewitness, James Akirga, told our correspondent on Sunday that Jukun militia in their numbers attacked the village at about 3pm killing seven people and setting the entire village ablaze. “Some of us managed to escape, but the attackers killed seven people and set the entire village of about 45 houses ablaze. This is the fifth time in less than a week that Jukun militias are attacking our villages. “Some of the attackers were dressed in military uniform, while others were in plain clothes. When they were done with the damage and were retreating, I sighted a military Hilux van from my hideout driving out of the village,” he said. Akirga named other villages burnt within a period of two weeks in the area to include Tse-Ajayi, Akenawe, Tortsee, Mhambe, Agoor, NKST Jato, Imande-Ade, Lijam, Akesa, Tse-Yange and Kasuan Haske. When contacted, Police Public Relations Officer in Taraba, ASP. David Misal said he was not aware of any attack in the area. “I am yet to be communicated regarding any attack in the Takum local Government Area. For now I am not aware of any attack and nobody has communicated such information to me,” he said. Copyright PUNCH.
