Simon Utebor A rights group, the Centre for Change, has condemned the detention of an activist, Agba Jalingo, by the police, allegedly acting on the instructions of the Cross River State Government. A statement on Friday by the President, Centre for Change, Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin, said the continued detention of Jalingo by the police for over one week was a gross violation of his constitutional rights. She said the activist’s detention was coming at a time that Nigerians were demanding the release of Sahara Reporters publisher, Omoyele Sowore. Okei-Odumakin said, “The Centre for Change seriously condemns the continued display of intolerance for opposing views and abuse of power by the government. “The arrest and detention of Agba Jalingo is an attack on free speech and constitutes a violation of his rights to personal liberty, human dignity and due process. “The fundamental human rights of association and expression of views are protected and guaranteed by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Section 40 of the 1999 Constitution provides, among other things, that every person shall be entitled to assemble freely and associate with other persons, and in particular he or she may form or belong to any political party, trade union or any other association for the protection of his or her interests.” Copyright PUNCH.
