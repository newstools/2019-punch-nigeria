Raphael Ede, Enugu The South-East Amalgamated Markets Traders Association, on Thursday, appealed to the Federal Government to review the period of closure of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, to 60 days. The President-General of SEAMATA, Chief Gozie Akudolu, who made the appeal in a statement, said the call for a review became important because of the far-reaching effects that the long closure of the airport would have on businesses in the zone. Akudolu said the airport remained a first-choice airport for traders in the region, adding that traders from the South-East would be greatly affected. He said, “Much as the reason for the closure of the airport is to fix the failed portions of the airport runway that will guarantee the safety of the passengers and the aircraft, it is our considered opinion that this can be effectively and efficiently achieved in less than 60 days.” The SEAMATA boss also called on all the relevant authorities to professionally establish the cause of the failure of the runway towards providing a lasting solution. “This is necessary considering the inconvenience the closure of the airport causes the teeming passengers and the huge revenue loss to the government and people as well. This is why SEAMATA calls on the Federal Government to review the period of closure of this airport to 60 days,’’ he added. The Federal Government, through the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, had notified airlines, passengers and stakeholders that the runway of the airport would be closed for major repairs on August 24.
