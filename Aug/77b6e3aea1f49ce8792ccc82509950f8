Anna Okon The Vice-Chairman, Presidential Taskforce on Apapa gridlock, Kayode Opeifa, has assured residents of Apapa that end was in sight for the menace. He gave the assurance  on Tuesday during a town hall meeting organised to allay concerns  about activities of the taskforce and to generate more ideas towards achieving the sustainability of free flow of traffic at Apapa and to enable residents take ownership of the space. Opeifa declared that the team had achieved what it was set up to accomplish. He said, “Now we have been able to ensure that no trucks stay on the roads anywhere in Apapa. “We have busted the issue of extortion which was a by-product of the demurrage system that was hitherto in operation which the Nigerian Shippers Council and the Ship owners are already working on with terminal operators. “The NSC has been able to negotiate a slash in the demurrage and we believe once this is put into operation, it would reduce the pressure to get into Apapa and the number of trucks would drastically reduce.” Copyright PUNCH.
