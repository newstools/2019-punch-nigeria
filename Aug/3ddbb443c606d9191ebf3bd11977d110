Chukwudi Akasike Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said that the state security council will deploy more security personnel in troubled Ogoni communities with a view to restoring peace. Wike, who spoke on Saturday when he led the Department of State Services commanders to Kono-Boue and Kereken-Boue towns in the Khana Local Government Area, said the security agencies had been mobilised  to go after cult members operating in parts of Ogoniland. “We will do everything possible to make sure that those involved in these cult activities don’t go scot free,” he said. The governor explained that the state security council had adopted new strategies to build the security framework in communities troubled by cult members. He said, “Tell your people to come back. I have come here with the security service commanders to reassure you that we are doing everything possible to restore peace. “Over the last few days, we have deployed security personnel in the troubled areas. Beginning from today, we are going to deploy more security personnel in different Ogoni communities to protect our people.” Wike charged parents to monitor their children, adding that communities must  take measures to discourage youths from becoming cult members. The governor said the state government would support displaced communities and families of victims of the cult-related attacks in Ogoniland. Copyright PUNCH.
