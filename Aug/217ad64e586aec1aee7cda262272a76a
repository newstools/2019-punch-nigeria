Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government has intensified efforts to track down those bent on sabotaging its Social Investment Programmes by exploiting beneficiaries for personal gains, or sensationalising false statements to discredit the projects, the Special Adviser to the President on Social Investments, Maryam Uwais, has said. She also stated that the government would continue to be transparent and accountable in the implementation of the programmes. The presidential adviser, who stated this in a statement issued on Sunday by the National Social Investment Office, disclosed that the NSIO was working with relevant security agencies to ensure that abusers of the SIPs were arrested and prosecuted. Her response was against the backdrop of reports which quoted her to have accused some monarchs of collecting bribes from beneficiaries of the intervention programmes. She urged members of the public to dismiss such reports and described them as sensationalism and a total misrepresentation of facts. Uwais, who delivered a goodwill message at the 13th anti-corruption agenda for the 9th National Assembly in Abuja recently, said she did not mention monarchs as among those involved in demanding kickbacks from SIP beneficiaries in rural areas.
