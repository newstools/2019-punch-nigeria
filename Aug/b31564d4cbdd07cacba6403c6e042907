Sola Shittu, Benin Security guards on Monday beat up the Chairman of the Ovia South-West Local Government Area, Destiny Enabulele who allegedly tried to force his way into the reception venue for the 80th birthday of a former chairman of the All Progressive Congress, Chief John Odigie Oyegun. Enabulele, who approached the entrance of the venue in company with his aides, was asked to produce his invitation card but was unable to do so. Attempts by his aides to introduce him were rebuffed by the guards who insisted on seeing the access card. When he was asked to turn back Enabulele insisted on having his way. He was immediately grabbed by the neck by the security guards and thrown out.
