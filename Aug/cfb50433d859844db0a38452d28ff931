Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Ekiti State Government has started moves targeted at conducting energy audit of communities in the state with a view to determining their appropriate power needs. The Commissioner for Infrastructure, Bamidele Faparusi, said the Dr Kayode Fayemi administration was committed to improving the lives of Ekiti people by making electricity available. Faparusi spoke in Ado Ekiti on Wednesday while inaugurating a Baseline Energy Survey Committee set up by the state government to conduct a survey for “un-served and underserved” rural communities in the state.
