Tunde Oyekola The Ilorin Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Friday arrested Oyediran Joseph, said to be one of the “most wanted” suspected internet fraudsters by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. EFCC said the 36-year-old suspect was arrested in Ilorin, Kwara State recently. The Zonal Head of the Commission, Sharu Isyaku, told reporters at a news briefing on Friday that “the 36-year-old suspect had benefited from about N60m from the loot via Western Union Transfer.” The Ilorin zonal office of EFCC covers Kwara, Kogi and Ekiti states. The FBI had arrested no fewer than 78 Nigerians in the USA, who were indicted for internet fraud and cyber crime-related offences amounting to millions of dollars. Isyaku said, “Just last three weeks, the US authority had
written to us for assistance in tracking and possible arrest and
prosecution of two most wanted FBI suspects in Nigeria. “The Commission acceded to their request. “The Commission has been supportive of the activities of the FBI and every other foreign counterpart whose responsibility is similar or analogous to ours.” He revealed that the zone had traced four properties linked to
some cyber crime suspects in choice areas at Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State. He said the properties include supermarket and plaza with market value of between N800m and N1bn. Said he: “Within seven months of our operation, the Ilorin zonal
office has independently arrested over 58 suspected internet
fraudsters, secured conviction of 25 and got forfeiture of their exotic cars and money running into millions of Naira.”
