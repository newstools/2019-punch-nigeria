Nike Popoola Sovereign Trust Insurance Plc says it has extended its rights issue offer closing date following approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm said the rights issue which ought to have closed in July 31had been extended to August 16. A statement from the spokesperson for the firm, Mr Segun Bankole, said the extension of the rights issue became necessary to allow shareholders ample time to subscribe fully to the offer. He said such opportunity did not come that often and this informed the decision of the management to request for an extension in the closing date of the rights issue offer. The company urged its shareholders to take advantage of the extension to fully exercise their rights, adding that it would guarantee the consolidation of their ownership in the underwriting firm. STI stated that it was poised to take the insurance business to a greater height as it moved to its next phase of growth agenda. The firm said a total of 4,170,411,648 ordinary shares at 50 kobo each had been placed on offer for existing shareholders at 50 kobo per share on the basis of one new ordinary share for every two ordinary shares of 50 kobo held in the company as at the close of register on January 15. The Managing Director, STI, Mr Olaotan Soyinka, said the company had set a growth agenda aimed at positioning it as a top player particularly in oil and gas. He called on the firm’s shareholders to support the rights issue within the new date extension. Copyright PUNCH.
