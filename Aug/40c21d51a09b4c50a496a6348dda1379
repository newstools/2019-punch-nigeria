Olaide Oyelude and Maiharaji Altine Bandits  on Sunday killed four persons  in  Tsayu village,  Jibiya Local Government Area of Katsina State. The gangsters reportedly invaded the village at  about 5.30pm  to rustle cows. But the  villagers  mobilised and pursued the hoodlums who escaped   into the forest after  rustling  four  cows. The bandits allegedly attacked the villagers, killing four of them. Spokesman for  the police in the state, ASP Anaz Gezawa, confirmed the incident in a  statement  on Monday. He said, “The bandits killed four of the villagers  and escaped in to the thick hilly mountainous forest.” Gezawa sought  residents’ help to rid  the state of banditry, kidnapping, robbery  and other criminal activities. Meanwhile, Fulani herdsmen on Monday  allegedly killed a Fulani bandit near Kango village in Dansadau, Maru Local Government  Area of  Zamfara State and brought his AK-47 rifle  to Government House, Gusau. The  Senior Special Assistant to Governor Bello Matawalle on Security, Alhaji Abubakar Dauran,  said the bandit was killed by some Fulani herdsmen when he blocked the road leading to Dansadau town in an attempt to rob people. According to Dauran, immediately   the herdsmen  were informed that  fellow  Fulaniman  was attempting  to rob passersby, they quickly mobilised to the spot to  engage him in a  gunfight  and succeeded in killing  him. He said, “They killed him instantly and brought his AK-47 gun  to us here at  Government House, an indication that the peace process is really working.” According to him, since the beginning of the peace initiative there has never been any case of kidnapping or killing in the state.
