Enyioha Opara, Minna The Nigerian Army has established a super camp in Kotonkoro, Mariga Local Government Area of Niger State, in a bid to curb insecurity in the area. The Commander, 31 Artillery Brigade, Minna, Brig. Gen. Gideon Ajetunmobi, said this while conducting the Secretary to the State Government, Ahmed Matane, round the facility on Thursday. He said the establishment of the camp was part of the strategies by the military high command to curb insecurity in the area in particular and the state in general. Ajetunmobi explained that Niger State shared boundaries with Zamfara and Kebbi states, hence the super camp would bring about the much-desired solution to the migration of bandits, kidnappers and cattle rustlers from the neighbouring states. The commander told the SSG that the super camp, which has been provided with basic facilities, was situated on a large expanse of land and had about 200 soldiers. In an address to the soldiers, Matane expressed confidence that the establishment of the camp would go a long way to curb insecurity in and around their operational area. He assured the soldiers of the state government’s readiness to provide additional facilities to enhance their operations. In his remarks, the Kotonkoro District Head, Alhaji Isa Usman, expressed optimism that the super camp’s establishment in his domain would address the migration, wanton carnage and other security challenges being perpetrated by bandits and kidnappers in the area.
