Anna Okon The General Secretary of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Peter Ozo-Eson has been replaced by Emmanuel Ogbuajah in a new appointment that took place during the meeting of the Central Working Committee of the NLC on Tuesday. Also appointed was Ismaheel Bello who was approved as the Deputy General Secretary of the congress, a source from the body disclosed. Until his appointment, Ogbuajah was NLC’s head of administration. Details of the appointments were still hazy as of the time of filing this report. Ozo-Eson’s appointment as general secretary of the union in 2014 was announced in a communiqué at the end of NLC’s National Executive Council, meeting in Enugu. His appointment came seven years after internal crisis led to the removal of the then General Secretary, John Odah, on May 24, 2011. After Odah’s removal, the NLC Secretariat was left in the hands of officials in acting capacity. In 2013,  Owei Lakemfa, a senior assistant secretary, was appointed to serve briefly as acting General Secretary of the Congress. When  Lakemfa later moved over to the Organisation of African Trade Union Unity, as Secretary-General, Chris Uyot took over. Ozo-Eson emerged winner of an election that was held shortly  after Lakemfa’s exit.  He defeated two other candidates, including the acting General Secretary, Uyot. Copyright PUNCH.
