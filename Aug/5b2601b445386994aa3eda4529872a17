He said, “Sometimes ago, the Speaker of the House of Representative came here and donated a mobile clinic but up till now, no single drug is inside. The containers are empty. “We have pipe-borne water in the camp but we don’t have a generator. We will be grateful if you can provide us with a generator.” He also appealed to the government for employment, saying many of the displaced persons at the camp were educated. Bitrus stated, “We have a total of 676 youths in this camp and most of them have a diploma, NCE and other educational qualifications but they have no work to do. We will like to be employed.”
