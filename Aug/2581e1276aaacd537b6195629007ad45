Maiharaji Altine, Gusau Zamfara State Police commissioner, Usmam Nagogo, has said that repentant bandits in the state have now resorted to fighting those, who are not ready to follow the path of peace. Briefing newsmen today in his office, the police commissioner said, “The trust we built have started to bring positive results because the bandits have so much trust in the process and are now becoming our eyes and ears in the forest”. According to the commissioner, the bandits were ready to take on anybody among their kinsmen, who is not ready to toe the line of peace as contemplated by the Inspector General of Police and the Zamfara State Government. The commissioner gave three instances where the bandits killed some recalcitrants among them, recovered their rifles and handed them over to him.
