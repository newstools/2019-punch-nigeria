Enyioha Opara, Minna The Niger State Police Command has arrested three suspects for alleged robbery, rape and kidnapping in the Shiroro Local Government Area of the state. The suspects, Yusuf Sule, 22; Sale Sarki, 35; and Juli Baushi, 23, all from Maranje-Madagwa village, Shiroro, were arrested on August 8, 2019, while reportedly trying to escape from a crime scene. Northern City News gathered on Thursday that police detectives from the Erena Division in Shiroro swung into action when they received information that six armed men had robbed one Abdullahi Bako of the Madagwa village of N50,000. It was learnt that after robbing their victim, the suspects raped two female members of his household and abducted two women, whose names were given as Khadijat Garba and Faiza Alhassan. The police said the suspects had been engaged in criminal activities for the past two years. One of the suspects, Sarki, said in an interview with our correspondent, “We are into robbery, kidnapping and other crimes just to make ends meet, because there are no jobs in the country and we must survive.” The command’s Public Relations Officer, Muhammad Abubakar, confirmed the incident, saying police operatives were on the trail of other fleeing members of the gang. Abubakar also said police personnel rescued the abducted women from the suspects, adding that they would be charged after investigation. Copyright PUNCH.
