Peter Dada, Akure The pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, on Saturday, met with the new Yoruba leader, Prof. Banji Akintoye, on his election. Akintoye was elected as the leader of Yoruba a few days ago in Ibadan by a group but this was greeted with criticisms. The meeting was held behind closed doors at the residence of the Afenifere leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti, in Akure, the Ondo State capital. Some of the chieftains of the group at the meeting, according to a source, included Pa Ayo Adebanjo; the Secretary-General of the group, Chief Seinde Arogbofa; the Publicity Secretary of the group, Mr  Yinka  Odumakin; Chief Sola Ebiseni, Chief Supo Sonibare, Chief Olaitan Osun and Chief Demola Folarin. The source said the meeting was not unconnected with the issue of Akintoye’s new position, which was earlier greeted by criticism from some quarters. However, when contacted on Sunday, Odumakin said the meeting had nothing to do with Akintoye’s new position.

He said, “Prof. Akintoye is one of us, so  together we went to visit Pa Fasoranti because since the death of his daughter, we have not met with him. That is what we have gone to do in Fasoranti’s house.” Copyright PUNCH.
