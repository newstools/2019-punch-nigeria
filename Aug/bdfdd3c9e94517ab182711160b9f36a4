The newly debuted CNN African Voices programme tagged, ‘Changemakers,’ will this week feature Nigerian child empowerment advocate, Seyi Oluyole. In a statement, Globacom, which sponsors the programme, said Oluyole was the second guest to be featured in the new magazine-styled programme. Oluyole, a 27-year-old graduate of English and Literary Studies, will be featured alongside 60-year-old South African, Nokugcina Elsie Mhlophe. According to Globacom, the two guests who are choreography and dance experts will discuss how they are changing the fortunes of “street kids through dance and storytelling in their respective countries.” The firm said, “To achieve her aim of assisting poor children scrounging a living on the streets, Oluyole founded a non-governmental organisation called The Dream Nurture Foundation to provide succour to them.
