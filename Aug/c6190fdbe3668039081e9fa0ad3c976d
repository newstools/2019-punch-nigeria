Housemate, Khafi Kareem has won a 7.6 million Naira IVM Fox car in the ongoing BBNaija season four. News Agency of Nigeria reports that Khafi won the car prize during the ‘Proudly Nigerian’ challenge on Saturday. The challenge, sponsored by Nigerian brand, Innosson Motors, tasked housemates to present their Nigerian stories and highlight the beauty of being Nigerian. During the first round, housemates shared their Nigerian story, however, Khafi’s presentation got viewers emotional. At the end of the first round, housemates were asked to pull ribbons attached to the Innosson car. Those who dropped the ribbons were disqualified. Afterwards, some housemates were distracted by Pizza and noise, which left Khafi, Mercy, Cindy and Jackye the quartet still standing. NAN reports that the other women eventually dropped their ribbon, leaving Khafi to win the coveted prize. Reacting to her win, Khafi said she loved the red colour of the car. Fans have taken to social media to congratulate her and pass remarks about her presentation. @Juliet_ said, “Congrats Khafi, a win well deserved.

I’m happy for her.” @Chanty4 said, “Salute to the Nigerian spirit. Salute to Khafi. Congratulations to the last four. #BBNaijia #BBNaijaPepperDem.” (NAN)
