Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi The Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has sacked his Special Adviser on Political Affairs, Musa Shittu, barely six weeks after his appointment. Shittu was appointed along with four other special advisers in July and was sworn. This was contained in a statement signed by the governorâ€™s spokesman, Dr Ladan Salihu, on Friday. The statement, which said the disengagement was with immediate effect, did not give reasons for it. He said that the governor thanked the former special adviser for his contributions towards the development of the state and wished him success in his future endeavors. Copyright PUNCH.
