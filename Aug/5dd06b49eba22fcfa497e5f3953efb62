Samuel Awoyinfa The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency has warned applicants that it is not recruiting any cadre of staff through any online platform. This warning came on the heels of a gale of misinformation in circulation that there was an ongoing recruitment exercise at NIMASA. The agency, in a statement made available to our correspondent on Tuesday, indicated that it had not embarked on any recruitment exercise at the moment; and  was not associated with any of the adverts being brandished on various social media platforms to defraud members of the public. The statement read in part, “The attention of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency has been drawn to the misinformation making the round on some online platforms, that there is an ongoing recruitment exercise in the agency. “It is important to state that the Agency has not embarked on any recruitment exercise at the moment; and not associated with any of the adverts being brandished on various social media platforms to defraud members of the public.” The agency said the scammers claiming to be consultants to NIMASA had been involved in the use of social media and/or text messages,     e-mails, as well as letters inviting job seekers for job interviews at different locations across the country. It stated that it had not hired anyone for such purpose. The management appealed to the public to ignore such advertisement from these unscrupulous elements, warning that the relevant authorities had been contacted to track their activities and deal with them decisively.
