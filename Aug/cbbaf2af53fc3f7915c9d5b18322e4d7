OCHEI MATTHEW The Delta State Police Command says it has arrested a five-man syndicate of motorcycle snatchers in the Ika South Local Government Area of the state. The Police Public Relations Officer, Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the development on Saturday. The police spokesperson explained that on August 12, 2019, based on intelligence report received by men on stop-and-search attached to Abavo Police Station, two suspects: Kingsely Onaro, 25, and Aghulor Udoka, 25, were arrested on Abavo road with two stolen motorcycles. She said, “During the interrogation of the suspects, Onaro narrated how he usually went to people’s houses in the wee hours of the day to remove motorcycles from where they were parked while the owners were asleep. “They mentioned a 41-year-old Odogwu Chukwudi who is the middleman and the receiver/seller of the stolen motorcycles and one Blessing Chukwudi, female, who sells the motorcycles after registering them with fake documents. “Also arrested was one Rita Ifeanyi, an agent with the state licensing office who provided them with the fake documents. She said 15 motorcycles were recovered from the suspects and so far six persons had been able to identify their motorcycles despite the change of number plate.” She informed the general public that anyone whose motorcycle was stolen in Owa-Oyibu and its environs, should go to Owa-Oyibu Police Station to check, assuring the public of the command’s commitment to protecting the lives and property of the people.
