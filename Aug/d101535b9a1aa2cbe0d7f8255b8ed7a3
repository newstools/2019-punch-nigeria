Kayode Idowu, Damaturu Yobe State Governor, Alhaji Mai-Mala Buni, and the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Shippers’ Council, Hassan Bello, have met in Lagos to discuss arrangements for the construction of a modern trailer park and mechanic village in the state. A statement by the spokesman for the governor, Mallam Abdullahi Bego, indicated that arrangements had been concluded for a groundbreaking foundation laying ceremony for the construction in Potiskum. He said the governor’s meeting with the NSC boss came ahead of the foundation laying ceremony slated for September 4, 2019. Bego said the Yobe State Government and the NSC were working together under the Public Private Partnership to construct the modern transportation hub in Potiskum. He disclosed that the state government had also provided 50 hectares of land for the park in Potiskum. He said the project would be completed within 18 months once bidding processes were finalised. The governor had at the town hall meeting in Potiskum recently told the people that the modern trailer park would help decongest and clean up Potiskum as well as provide a modern business environment for the town’s bourgeoning trucking business. Bego quoted Bello as saying over 5,000 direct jobs could be created from the truck park facility. “Potiskum has the largest concentration of trucks and it’s fitting that truck drivers have a dignified hub to transit and rest as they continue with their trucking activities. They also need a modern mechanic village for the maintenance of their vehicles,” Bello said. The NSC boss added that the park would not only be used by trailer drivers but all motorists who might wish to use it as a transit point. Copyright PUNCH.
