Following the incident, NYPD launched an appeal for officers to donate blood at the hospital where the officer is admitted. Eight NYPD officers have committed suicide so far this year, prompting the department to declare a mental health crisis among its ranks. The New York Commissioner of Police, James O’Neill, had issued a statement urging distressed officers to seek help. “There is no shame in seeking assistance from the many resources available, both inside and outside the department. “Accepting help is never a sign of weakness; in fact, it is a sign of great strength”, O’Neill said.
