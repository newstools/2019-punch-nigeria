Adelani Adepegba, Abuja Barely 96 hours after landing in New Delhi for medical treatment, leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Sheikh Ibraheem el-Zakzaky, has reportedly discharged himself from the Medenta Hospital and is now on his way back to Nigeria. The President, Media Forum of IMN, Ibrahim Musa, said that El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat, who were airborne as of the time of speaking with our Correspondent on Thursday evening, left New Delhi around 5:00 p.m. Nigerian time, heading back to the country. Musa, in a statement, blamed the Federal Government for scuttling the IMN leader’s planned treatment. Musa said, “Following lack of a breakthrough in the impasse that ensued in the treatment in New Delhi of Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky, it is now confirmed that the Sheikh is on his way back to Abuja.

The FG had earlier refuted El-Zakzaky’s allegations, stating that he attempted to violate the conditions of his treatment by making unreasonable demands, including insisting on lodging in a five-star hotel in New Delhi with free access to “all manner of visitors.”
