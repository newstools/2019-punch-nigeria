Fisayo Odumuyiwa The Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Housing, Mrs Toke Benson-Awoyinka, has said the Lagos Ministry of Housing is ready to sanitise the real estate sector in the state. Benson-Awoyinka said this during a briefing in Lagos, saying the Lagos State Ministry of Housing had set up a regulatory body to provide a viable, efficient and well-governed social housing sector. She said the ministry was ready to create a portal, which would ensure easy and seamless registration of businesses by stakeholders, adding, “Anyone caught doing housing business without being registered by the ministry would be punish according to the law. “A developer was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and his property forfeited and sold to reimburse the affected citizens. We need citizens to blow whistle of any unregistered developer for punishment.” She expressed the readiness to sensitise the people with the help of community leaders, adding that over 4,500 CDCs and CDAs across the state would be enlisted. Benson-Awoyinka said, “Contrary to the erroneous belief that the state government is hostile to private business owners, the present administration, under Babajide Sanwo-Olu, is desirous of seeing every resident of the state prosper and contribute to the Gross Domestic Product of the country.” “The 21st Century vision of the state government demands that all real estate stakeholders and transactions be known and captured electronically with access to data by the citizens in real-time, as real estate to Lagos is as oil to Nigeria.” CopyrightPUNCH.
