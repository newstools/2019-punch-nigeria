Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Saturday said the resumption of work on Lagos-Ibadan rail line would “unavoidably stall the government’s free train ride programme for the Christmas and New Year festive season.” The Federal Government through the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, had on Friday ordered the China Civil Engineering and Construction Corporation, the contractor handling the 10 railway stations along the Lagos-Ibadan rail line to resume work immediately with a view to completing the projects unfailingly next month. A statement by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, Oyetola expressed regret that following the directive by the Federal Government, no train would be allowed to ply the standard gauge rail line until completion of the project in January 2020. He said the development had disrupted the free train ride programme usually funded by the Osun government in support of the people. Omipidan in the statement noted that Oyetola, had prioritised the free train services for citizens and other travellers during festivities, as his administration in continuation of the initiative by his predecessor, assured the people that his administration would remain strongly committed to the welfare of the people. The statement read, “The free train ride programme is an important part of our administration’s welfare promise. It started from the last administration and has continued to date.  It is in fulfillment of part of our campaign promises to continue with the good works started by my predecessor. “We, however, regret that hundreds of beneficiaries of this good welfare programme will have to patiently wait until the next festive season, following the on-going work on the Lagos-Ibadan rail line.
