The Nigeria Immigration Service has mandated all its officers to undergo drug tests to ensure proper handling of weapons. The Comptroller General of the NIS, Mr Muhammad Babandede, disclosed this in a statement by the Service Public Relations Officer, Mr Sunday James, on Saturday in Abuja. He warned officers and men to be cautious in the use of weapons in the course of duty. “We cannot afford to be careless with weapon, hence, all officers of the service will undergo drug test beginning with me. We shall not dismiss anyone at first discovery but we would try to rehabilitate. “However, if the fellow continued unrepentant, administrative procedures will be followed and appropriate sanctions applied,” he said. Meanwhile, the NIS has graduated 509 officers of the third Conversion and Upgrading Course at the Immigration Training School, Kano. Babandede urged the officers to cherish their new ranks by aligning with the commitment and dedication to the duty of the superintendent cadre. He reiterated the need for the officers to put what they learnt into action, noting that the service had invested so much into training and capacity development. He encouraged them to maximise the knowledge of ICT gained to uplift the standard of the service among other sister agencies by complementing each other whenever the need arises. On the visa-on-arrival policy, the CGI said it was a huge opportunity for Africans that were coming for legitimate businesses to thrive in countries other than their own. He added that it was a means of integration and cementing African brotherhood and breaking the barriers of free movement among Africans. He assured Nigerians that the policy would be handled professionally through best global practices without compromising national security. (NAN)
