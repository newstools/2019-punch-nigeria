The Police in London have teamed up with council officials to arrest a landlord who had rented out a ramshackle building to 30 people to live in. Thirty occupants were discovered crammed into a squalid three-bedroom property in east London, Independent UK had reported. The Police said the occupants, including children, lived in filthy condition at the house in Dagenham. Police and council officers raided the dingy house on Monday, December 16, and have arraigned the landlord for prosecution. “More than 25 people were thought to be living in the main building, while two were in an illegal makeshift shed in the garden,” officials told the medium. “I find it terribly depressing. It is exploitation. Misery is inflicted on people in the name of bad landlords trying to make a profit. “I can’t even imagine having children living in those conditions. Until the housing crisis is dealt with, you will keep getting these rogue landlords, but we will keep fighting them,” a council official, Margaret Mullane, was quoted to have said. The local authority said it was serving the landlord with an enforcement notice for infringements under the Housing Act – including damp, fire safety, and disrepair. The landlord could be hit with an unlimited fine, plus court costs if he is convicted.
