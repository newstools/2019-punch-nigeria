Chima Azubuike, Gombe Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya, has reacted to the recent statistics by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics on corruption index of states, placing Gombe second. Yahaya stated this on Monday at the World Anti-Corruption Day organised by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Gombe. He said, “We are ready to fight corruption and we will take this campaign against corruption to the next level. According to  President Muhammadu Buhari, if you don’t kill corruption, corruption will kill you. “No one is surprised by the rating by NBS. The last administration plundered the state. Despite the Federal Government’s bailout, budget support, it could not pay retirees. My presence here is an attestation that we have zero tolerance for corruption. “Both elected and appointed officials must eschew corruption and citizens should expose those involved. We shall act appropriately with the support of relevant agencies to bring culprits to justice.”
