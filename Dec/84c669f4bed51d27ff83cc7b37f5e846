Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Government has urged residents to endure the inconvenience that will be caused by the closure of the Mile 2 – TinCan Island Road area of the state. The state Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, who noted that the closure would be for three days, said it would allow the Federal Government to carry out palliative work on the road without any hindrance. Oladeinde added that the personnel of the ministry would supervise the palliative work to ensure that the closure did not exceed three days, noting that various law enforcement agencies would be on the ground to direct traffic. He said, “As a government agency with the mandate to manage traffic and transportation in the state, findings by my ministry clearly indicated that frequent accidents by articulated vehicles and trucks in the area was occasioned by the deplorable condition of the road between Mile 2 and TinCan Island and there is an urgent need to allow the Federal Government to carry out the palliative work so as to ease traffic congestion and prevent further accident in that region. “The ministry of transportation will not announce the closure of any road for construction if it is not for public interest, so I urge the residents to bear the pains and cooperate with the state government for the three days that the closure will last.” Oladeinde further appealed to commuters, truck owners and other relevant stakeholders to take note of the traffic arrangement and comply accordingly.
