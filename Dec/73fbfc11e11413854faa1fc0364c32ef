â€™Femi Asu The United States imported 52.99 million barrels of Nigerian crude oil from January to September this year, compared to the 48.18 million barrels bought in the same period in 2018. Latest data from the US Energy Information Administration showed that the country imported 9.59 million barrels of crude from Nigeria in the first quarter of 2019; 18.98 million barrels in Q2, and 24.41 million barrels in Q3. The US oil imports from Nigeria plunged to 539,000 barrels per day in February from 4.87 million bpd in January but rose to 4.19 million barrels in March. The Northern American country increased its imports of Nigerian crude from 3.92 million barrels in April to 7.52 million and 7.54 million barrels in May and June respectively. It bought 5.71 million, 11.78 million and 6.92 million barrels in July, August and September respectively, according to the EIA data. The US has significantly reduced imports of Nigerian crude oil in the past few years as the oil produced in its shale operations is similar to the light sweet Nigerian crude. US imports of Nigerian crude fell from 148.48 million barrels in 2012 to 87.40 million barrels in 2013 on the back of shale oil boom. In 2014, when global oil prices started to fall from a peak of $115 per barrel, Nigeria saw a further drop in US imports of its crude to 21.24 million barrels. For the first time in decades, the US did not purchase any barrel of Nigerian crude in July and August 2014 as well as June 2015, according to the EIA data. In 2010, the US bought as much as 358.92 million barrels from Nigeria, but slashed its imports to 280.08 million barrels in 2011. Copyright PUNCH.
