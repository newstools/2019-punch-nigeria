At least 50 of the 153 members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, University of Nigeria, Nsukka chapter, who enrolled in the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, are set to withdraw. The Chairman of UNN-ASUU, Mr Christian Opata, while briefing newsmen on Wednesday in Nsukka said other lecturers who failed to withdraw their enrollment would be queried. He said of the 153 enrollees, at least 50 indicated interest to withdraw from the system, since they registered out of misinformation. He said, “In this congress, I briefed members on NEC’s last meeting in Minna, where ASUU leadership insisted that IPPIS is illegal and a complete violation of university autonomy and agreement between government and ASUU. “During this congress, 50 lecturers, who have wrongly enrolled said they will withdraw their enrollment in IPPIS immediately.” The chairman said the congress agreed to publish the names of all the 153 lecturers, who enrolled in IPPIS in UNN-ASUU information board. “ASUU-UNN will issue queries to these defaulting members as well as forward their names to national body for appropriate sanction. “This is because ASUU national body said from the beginning that IPPIS enrollment is a complete violation of university autonomy and illegal,” Opata said.
