A 20-year-old woman, Shafa’atu, on Wednesday prayed a Shari’a court sitting at Rigasa, Kaduna State to dissolve the union between her and her husband, Sulaiman, for lack of care. The complainant told the court that the defendant had abandoned her when she was four months old pregnant. “I left his house because he doesn’t provide for me, and he refused to come and see me in my parent’s house; they were the ones that took care of me and my pregnancy. “When I was in labour, my sister called him to inform him about my condition, but he neither came nor send any money for my hospital bill,” she said. She noted that she had delivered a lifeless baby after the doctor’s advice for a cesarean operation. She said she was no longer interested in the marriage and wanted a divorce. The defendant denied the claim, saying the complainant left his house with no misunderstanding between them. He said he tried to make peace with his wife but to no avail, adding that the complainant should return the N45, 000 dowry he gave to her in exchange for divorce. The judge, Dahiru Bamalli, after listening to both parties requested the presence of the couples’ guardian in court. The complainant’s guardian Umar, who was in court, said his daughter would not return to the defendant’s house, praying the court to dissolve the union. He noted that the dowry was N30,000 not N45,000 as mentioned by the defendant. Umar said the defendant sold some of his daughter’s belongings and urged the court to assist recover the items. The judge adjourned till Feb. 18, for the defendant to present his father in court. (NAN)
