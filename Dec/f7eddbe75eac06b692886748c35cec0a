Sola Shittu, Benin Edo State House of Assembly on Monday wrote the Independent National Electoral Commission, calling for fresh elections in the constituencies of 14  members whose seats were declared vacant last week. This is coming on the heels of a contempt suit filed by Mr Anselm Ojezua against the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole; and the party’s new chairman in the state, Col. David Imuse. The Speaker of the House, Mr Frank Okiye, in an exclusive interview with The PUNCH, said, “We have written to INEC already, informing the commission of the vacant seats and calling for fresh election into all the affected states constituencies and we are waiting for their response to our letter.

He said, “It is a laughable matter because the matter is before the court. “We are challenging the illegal inauguration of the House and anything put on nothing cannot stand. “Okiye is a man that is in search of identity, he is working with the governor in the pursuit of a blind ambition, and they have hit the rock.” Ojezu, who was recently expelled from the party, said he has filed a contempt suit against Oshiomhole and Imuse. “I have asked my lawyers to initiate contempt proceedings against them,” he said.
