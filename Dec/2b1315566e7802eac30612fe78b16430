Anna Okon The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association has called on the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities to find a meeting point on the issue of enrolment of members of the union on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System. Speaking on the feud between the Federal Government and ASUU over the implementation of the IPPIS, the Director General of NECA, Dr Timothy Olawale, urged the Federal Government and ASUU to find a common ground. He cautioned both parties against allowing the situation to degenerate into an industrial action that would further cripple and slow down the education sector. Olawale said there were processes for resolving disagreements in the country’s industrial relations system, adding that either of the parties could initiate the process. He said, “Both the Federal Government and ASUU have their respective views and positions, which is quite understandable. However, it is very critical and important for both parties to find a meeting point on the issue. “Our educational system needs to be protected against unwarranted disruption. The interest of the students and the society should also be considered.” While appreciating the importance of implementing IPPIS, the NECA boss also stressed the peculiarity of the university system. He said the nature of the work of academics might not be suitable for IPPIS, and called for further consultations between the Federal Government and ASUU. CopyrightPUNCH.
