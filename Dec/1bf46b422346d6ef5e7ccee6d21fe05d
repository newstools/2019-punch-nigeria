Peter Dada, Akure An Ondo State High Court sitting in Akure has sentenced a man, Ekpemu John, to life imprisonment after finding him guilty of kidnapping the wife of the traditional ruler of Ikoya town in the Okitipupa Local Government Area of the state, Mrs Grace Faduyile. The convict, a member of a kidnapping gang that abducted the monarch’s wife, was arrested by the men of the state police command in 2017. A member of the gang was also killed by the police while rescuing the victim. John was later arraigned by the police on two counts of conspiracy and kidnapping. After listening to both the prosecuting and defence counsel, the trial judge, Justice Ademola Adegoroye, said he observed that all the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and John’s statement to the police indicted the convict. The court held that the prosecution had proved the case of kidnapping against the convict beyond reasonable doubt. The judge sentenced the convict to life imprisonment and said he might be given a state pardon if he was found to be of exemplary behaviour while serving his term. Copyright PUNCH.
