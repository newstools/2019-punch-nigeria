President Mahammadou Issoufou of Niger Republic, who is the Chairman, ECOWAS Authority of Heads of States and Government, has urged member states to “take a decisive approach in tackling terrorism in the sub-region.” Issoufou made the call on Saturday in Abuja at the opening of the 56th Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of States and Government. He said the West-African sub-region had been hard hit by terrorist attacks, which had intensified and had threatened many national and regional achievements and developments already made by member countries. Issoufou said it had, therefore, become very important for member states to respond to the recurring attacks. “The creation of a common area of peace, security and economic integration is without the slightest doubt the key to the future of our region. “Current regional and global developments in security constrains me to dwell on the security situation of our region. “Our region has been hard hit by terrorist attacks every passing day, threatening the national and regional achievements we have made. “We, therefore, hope that the prompt implementation of the recommendations of our extraordinary summit on terrorism held on September 14 in Ouagadougou will enable us to collectively meet this challenge, which appears to be an attack by faithless criminals on our dignity and Soverignity. “The terrorist attacks continually test our commitments to fighting the scourge. “It is therefore incumbent upon us to respond to all these attacks with firmness and determination,” Issoufou said. He added that counter-terrorism had a global dimension that should make the entire international community join in the fight. The chair of the meeting said apart from the issue of regional insecurity, ECOWAS should remain focused on economic reform projects and programmes. (NAN)
