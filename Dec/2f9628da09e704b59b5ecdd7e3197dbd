A former Minister of Aviation, Mr. Femi Fani-Kayode, has written an open letter to a former Minister of Defence, Lt.-Gen. Theophilus  Danjuma (retd.). Taking to his verified Twitter handle @realFFK on Sunday, Fani-Kayode had tweeted: Dear Gen. T.Y. Danjuma, “You still can’t find the balls to speak the truth & yet you are complaining about others? “You, more than any other, helped put the north in power on July 29th 1966. “You also supported Buhari in 2015. Speak NOW & free us from the bondage that you put us in.” Fani-Kayode, who claims that the nation had lost so much that it doesn’t have anything more to lose, says, “We have nothing to lose anymore. We have lost it all already: our nation, our freedom, our dignity, our honor and our self-esteem. “The only thing that we have left to fear is fear itself and death: yet to die is Christ and to live is gain!” He then urged, “FEAR NOT and speak truth to power!” He added, “We must be bold enough to speak the truth and the truth is that Buhari is not our main problem, but all those who colluded with him & conspired to put him in power in 2015. “We warned them over and over again, yet they insisted on putting a beast in power. Now they are complaining!” He went ahead to name those who, he believed, put the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) in office, accusing them of demonstrating “poor judgment.” “Due to their poor judgement, hundreds of thousands have been killed in 4 years. “That blood cries to God in Heaven for vengeance.”
