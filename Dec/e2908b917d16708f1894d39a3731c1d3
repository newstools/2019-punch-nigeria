Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Government said it had arrested 15 persons and impounded five vehicles and three motorcycles for flouting the directive to street traders and motorcyclists to vacate the Marina area of the state. The Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tunji Bello, said this on Tuesday during the commencement of the beautification of the outer Marina to the State House, Marina. Bello stated that those arrested had been handed over to the appropriate enforcement agencies for prosecution, adding that all illegal structures in the area had been dismantled so that traffic could flow. “Commercial vehicle operators in Marina should desist from dropping passengers or stopping at the foot of the bridge; rather, they should do so at designated parks in the area; also, street traders seen around the area engaging in any commercial activities will be prosecuted as well as miscreants and all those found loitering around the foot of the bridge,” he stated. While urging the residents of the state to desist from indiscriminate dumping of refuse, the commissioner gave an assurance that the beautification and landscaping project would be extended to other parts of the state.
