Samson Folarin The Lagos State Government on Thursday declared zero tolerance for street traders, operators of food courts by the roadside and abandoned vehicles. The Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, asked operatives of the Kick Against Indiscipline to maintain motorised patrols and ensure compliance with the order. A statement said the directive came following the successful removal of street traders, shanties, illegally parked vehicles and miscreants on the stretch of outer Marina last week. Bello, according to the statement, said the enforcement had been extended to areas around Mcwen Bridge, Muson Centre, Flag Staff House, Police AIG  Zone 2 Office Road, Onikan, Race Course Roundabout and the old State House, Marina. He reportedly said street traders and vehicles indiscriminately parked on the stretch of all the listed roads inhibited free flow of traffic. “The commissioner added that the same applies to owners of all vehicles abandoned or parked indiscriminately on the roadsides including the Onikan alignment, who must remove such vehicles immediately or risk being towed away. “He directed the Lagos State Waste Management Authority to deploy more street sweeping gangs to all the listed areas to ensure continuous sweeping of both dirt and sand and provision of special gangs to monitor the effectiveness of the sweeping gangs. “Bello said the task of cleaning up Lagos and restoring the greenery had begun and that there would be no looking back, reiterating that after the completion of the clean-up of Marina and it’s surrounding areas, the next port of call would be Ikoyi and Victoria Island,” the statement said.
