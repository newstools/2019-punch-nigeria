The DR Congo capital Kinshasa will be without water over the holiday season, a union representative at the public utility announced Sunday, citing unpaid wages and a crumbling infrastructure. An audio message from Alain Senenge, a union delegate at Regideso, advised Kinshasa residents to stock up on water because from next week, they would not be able to provide their service. The water treatment facilities were running out of parts, machines were breaking down and its workers had not received their last three months’ wages, said Senenge. The finance ministry had refused to release $5.4 million owed for its water consumption which would have allowed the utility to keep working, he added. A ministry statement said it was in the process of paying off those bills, but refused to accept responsibility for Regideso’s financial problems, blaming the company’s management. Kinshasa, a massive city of 12 million people, often has problems with its water supply. Those districts not connected to the Regideso network already use wells, rivers and even rainwater to meet their needs. While Regideso produced 560,000 cubic metres of water a day, the city needed 900,000 cubic metres, a spokesman for the company told AFP. On Monday, President Felix Tshisekedi will lay the first stone in a project to build a new Regideso plant in the KInshasa area producing drinkable water, which will have a capacity of 110,000 cubic metres a day, his office said.
