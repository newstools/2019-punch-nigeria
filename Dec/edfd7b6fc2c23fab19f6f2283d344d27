Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Igbo National Council has asked the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd.), to reverse his decision to grant visas on arrival  to Africans who intend to come into the country. INC in a statement in Owerri on Thursday by its national president, Chilos Godsent, and secretary,  Zulu Ofoelue, warned that the policy would endanger the country’s security apparatus. The pro-Igbo group stated that apart from increasing terrorist activities in the country, the economy of the nation would be endangered if the policy was not reversed. INC asked governors of the south-eastern states to put measures in place to halt the influx of Fulani herdsmen to the geopoliticcal zone. It asked state houses of assembly in the South-East to make laws that would forbid open grazing in the zone. It said, “Since the regrettable announcement of the visa free policy for African immigrants by the President Buhari-led administration, the Igbo National Council has taken a deep study of the socio-economic and security implications of such policy on Nigeria and its citizens, especially with the recent increase in nefarious activities of local and international terrorists organisations in Nigeria and Africa at large. “It is regrettable that this policy is coming when many African heads of state are coming together to fight against terrorism. “Unfortunately, since that regrettable announcement of visa-free policy by the Nigerian government, we have noticed huge influx of foreign Fulani herdsmen in some states in eastern Nigeria and the Middle Belt region, especially Benue, Ebonyi and Enugu states.” Copyright PUNCH.
