Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said that the state government’s investment in Oil Mining Licence 11 was aimed at protecting the interest of the state. Wike stated that the investment was targeted at promoting the interest of host communities and ensuring peace for the operation of the oil facility. The governor, who made this statement on Tuesday during a solidarity visit by the leadership of Ogbakor Etche to the Government House in Port Harcourt, explained that the efforts of the Rivers State Government were geared towards ensuring that the communities got the best from the acquisition of OML 11. He said, “What Rivers State Government wants is for our state to be protected. Whoever that is coming to take over will have the interest of the communities protected. “When the communities are part owners of OML 11, there will be peace. But some people sit down and engage in unnecessary propaganda.” The governor stated that the acquisition of OML 11 was the height of resource control struggle. CopyrightPUNCH.
