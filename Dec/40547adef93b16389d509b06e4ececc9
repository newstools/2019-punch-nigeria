Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Inland Revenue Service on Thursday denied claims made by the Office of the Auditor-General for the Federation that FIRS illegally deducted and failed to remit N210bn into the Federation Account. Speaking on the sidelines of the third annual meeting of the Nigerian Tax Research Network in Abuja, the Executive Chairman, FIRS, Babatunde Fowler, told journalists that his agency did not know where the Auditor-General for the Federation, Anthony Ayine, got his (Ayine) information. On Wednesday, an audit report signed by Ayine and released by the OAGF stated that out of the N6.4tn generated by revenue collection agencies in 2017, about N1.5tn was deducted and not remitted into the Federation Account in violation of the provisions of the Constitution. The report stated that the FIRS generated N2.66tn but paid about N2.45tn into Federation Account, which implied that the service deducted and failed to remit N210bn. When asked to explain why the agency deducted the sum, Fowler replied, “I don’t know where he (Ayine) got that information from because all the revenue that we generate goes to the Federation Account. We collect our monthly revenue during FAAC.
