Peter Dada, Akure A professor of Chemistry, Olu Aboluwoye, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission to streamline the number of political parties in Nigeria. Aboluwoye, who suggested that a two-party system would be better for the country, said it would strengthen the nation’s democracy. He made the suggestion at a lecture titled “Importance of electoral tribunal in development of democracy,” which he delivered at the South-West Herald Magazine Lecture and Award Night held in Akure, Ondo State, on Sunday evening. Aboluwoye alleged that Nigerian politicians had been exploiting the country’s electoral process for their own selfish advantage. He said, “With a minimal number of political parties, the unnecessary bottlenecks attached to the electoral processes in the country will be resolved.” The professor added that political parties must present what he described as “sellable candidates” as opposed to moneybags who had no attachments with the people. In his remarks, a Federal Commissioner of the National Population Commission, Mr Diran Iyantan, who was the chairman of the occasion, commended the organiser of the event, saying such an event would encourage stakeholders to contribute to the national discuss. The publisher of Southwest Heralds magazine, Mr Oluwatayo Adu, stated that the event was put together as part of the contribution of the media outfit to the realisation of an egalitarian society and recognising deserving patriotic Nigerians.
