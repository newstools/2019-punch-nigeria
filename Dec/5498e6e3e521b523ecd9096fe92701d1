Ada Wodu The acting Resident Electoral Commissioner of Cross River State, Ngozi Oghuma,  said  the non-sensitive election materials for the forthcoming bye-elections in the state have been received. Oghuma  said  this while speaking with journalists before  INEC’s band participated in  the Calabar Carnival on Saturday. The elections will take place in Abi/Yakurr Federal Constituency in Ekureku I and Ekureku II in 18 polling units, while the Abi State Constituency election will take place in 15 polling units. She said,  “We already have some non-sensitive materials. We are expecting other materials from the headquarters. The elections will take place on January 25. “We use this event (carnival)  to showcase what we do in INEC. We use it as a platform as approved by the commission to tell the public what we do. We are having some events that are coming up very soon. We encourage the public, that is, the electorate, those who have their voter’s cards to take care of them in view of using them when it is time for them to vote. “We also want to tell them that we will soon be having continuous voter registration. Those who want to do a transfer, those who are above 18 years, we will encourage them to come and register.” The election in Abi/Yakurr Federal Constituency is expected to be a straight fight between  Alex Egbona of the All Progressives Congress and  the immediate past Speaker of the state House of Assembly John Gaul-Lebo of the Peoples Democratic Party.
