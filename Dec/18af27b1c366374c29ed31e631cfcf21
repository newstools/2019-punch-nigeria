The Nigerians in Diaspora Commission has condemned the renewed attacks on Nigerian traders in Ghana, describing it as unnecessary. The Chairman/CEO of the commission, Mrs Abike Dabiri-Erewa, condemned the renewed attacks in a statement issued by NIDCOM’s Head of Media and Public Relations, Abdur-Rahman Balogun. She said that the reported cases of attacks on Nigerian shops and traders by Ghanaians were quite unfortunate. According to her, the attacks are happening at a time xenophobic attacks are becoming unpopular. She said that such attacks should be a thing of the past following interventions of Nigerian and Ghanaian leaders after September’s xenophobic attacks on foreigners and their businesses in South Africa.
