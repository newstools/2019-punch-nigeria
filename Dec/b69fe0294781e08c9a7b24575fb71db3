Daud Olatunji The police in Ogun State, on Saturday, banned street carnivals, rallies and processions in any part of the state to curb violence. There had been series of violence recorded in some parts of the state during the street carnivals. The police issued the ban with a stern warning that violators would be made to “face the full wrath of the law.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement said the command had placed an embargo on any form of street carnivals or public procession across the state. Oyeyemi said, “The ban becomes necessary due to series of violence and wanton destruction of valuable properties associated with such carnivals in recent time. “In view of this, the Commissioner of Police and his management team while reviewing the security situation in the state came to conclusion that the street carnivals have become an avenue through which some unscrupulous elements as well as cultists are using to unleash terror on innocent members of the public. “Therefore, all forms of street carnival are hereby banned and anybody who after this release organised carnival, rally, procession or blocked any public road anywhere in the state will be made to face the full wrath of the law.” Copyright PUNCH.
