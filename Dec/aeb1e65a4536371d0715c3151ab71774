Mudiaga Affe The Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party, Lagos State chapter, Mr Adedeji Doherty, has said the reign of the All Progressives Congress in the state will soon come to an end. Doherty was reacting to the comment by the Lagos State Chairman of the APC, Alhaji Tunde Balogun, on Thursday that the PDP was not destined to win elections in the state. Balogun reportedly made the comment at the APC secretariat in Ikeja when he received hundreds of PDP defectors. But Doherty, in a statement on Saturday, said Balogun was not in touch with reality, adding that Lagosians had long been yearning for a change that his party (PDP) was getting ready to provide in 2023. Apart from alleging that the APC had somewhat found its way to power through rigging, the PDP chairman also accused the APC-led administration in the state of accumulating huge debts in the state.

Lagos State is yearning for change and the change must come. We have endured 20 years of degradation and the state debt has hit the roof of over N2tn and still climbing. “The APC has ruled this state for over 20 years with little or nothing meaningful to show for it. Most of what we have seen has been cosmetic and not the real dividends of democracy.” Copyright PUNCH.
