Hindi Livinus, Yola Adamawa State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress has rejected the outcome of the local government council elections conducted in the state. The party’s state Legal Adviser, Shagnah Pwamadi, described the election as a selection backed by law enforcement agents as reason for the APC’s rejection of the polls. He said, “The APC is rejecting the outcome of the polls because the polls were not conducted in compliance with the provision of the Adamawa State electoral law. “Therefore, it is undemocratic and a clear display of an act of selection backed by law enforcement agencies.” Copyright PUNCH.
