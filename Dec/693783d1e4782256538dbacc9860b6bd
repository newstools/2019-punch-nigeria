Kamarudeen Ogundele The Forum of All Progressives Congress state Chairmen has backed the National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, in his bid to promote party supremacy. The forum said all members must toe the line of discipline and respect for the party hierarchy in order to promote internal democracy. It stated this in reaction to the recent lifting of the suspension on some notable members by the National Working Committee. The NWC had recently lifted the suspension on Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu; the immediate past governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun and his Imo State counterpart, Rochas Okorocha. The NWC also lifted the suspension on the Director General of Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, and the former Minister of Niger Delta, Usani Usani. Speaking with our correspondent, the secretary of the forum and state chairman of Enugu APC, Dr Ben Nwoye, said the supremacy of the party must be respected by all. “The recall of suspended APC members by the NWC is a welcome development. The move will help to reduce the tension between party leaders in the affected states,” Nwoye said. He said the actions taken by Oshiomhole would strengthen the party and serve as a deterrent to others. He stated, “The action of NWC served as a deterrent to others who may wish to undermine the party or engage in any form of anti-party activities in the future. “The party is supreme under the leadership of Adams Oshiomhole. Indeed, in the APC, nobody is above the law.” Copyright PUNCH.
