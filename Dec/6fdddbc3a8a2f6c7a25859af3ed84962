Abiodun Nejo The Chief Executive Officer of Promasidor Nigeria Limited, Mr Olivier Thiry, said on Friday that production of milk would begin in the Ikun Dairy Farm at Ikun in the Moba Council area of Ekiti State within the next 18 months. Thiry, who said the company had acquired about 400 cows for the first stage of activities in the farm, assured the people that no fewer than 1,000 Ekiti indigenes would be employed when fully operational, as he solicited the people’s support for success of the project. The Promasidor boss, who spoke at Ikun Ekiti while receiving Governor Kayode Fayemi, who was on an inspection tour of the facilities at the farm, said, “At full capacity, this farm will  produce over 10,000 litres of milk per day, over 1,000 Ekiti people will also be employed to work in the farm. “Promasidor has made an initial investment of $5m in the farm which will be invested to procure cattle, equip the dairy farm, establish a farm to produce feed and renovate existing buildings,” he said. The Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr Godwin Emefiele, represented by his Special Adviser on Finance, Mr Anthony Ifechukwu, laud Fayemi on his effort at bringing more investors which would translate to the development of the state.
