I am not impressed at all with how the government is being run.” He explained that as the Campaign Director of Matawalle Campaign Organization, none of his members were given any appointment, as such, he decided to reject the offer to serve in the Governor’s cabinet to avoid embarrassment in the future. “Another reason that made me resign is that, when I was sick and travelled to India for medical treatment, where I spent 40 days, the Governor never called me to know about my condition. So, I feel that I can’t serve in his cabinet,” he added. Shinkafi resigned his appointment after being appointed by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(Retd.), as a member of the National Assembly Commission. Marafa explained that he resigned in order to pay more attention to his business.
