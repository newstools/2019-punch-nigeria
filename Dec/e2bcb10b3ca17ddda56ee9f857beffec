Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo Osun State Government on Thursday said it had started a project called Customised State Integrated Financial Management Information System to check revenue leakage and ensure transparency. The Commissioner for Finance, Mr Bola Oyebamiji, who disclosed this in a statement in Osogbo, said being a globally acceptable platform for open governance, the project would be completed and launched in another six months. According to him, the project would further boost the accountability style of governance which the Adegboyega Oyetola administration had always strived to achieve. Oyebamiji said the project among other benefits, would also assist in the preparation of the stateâ€™s annual budgets through an automated process for efficiency. He further explained that the state had already commenced the reform, even without external support. Copyright PUNCH.
