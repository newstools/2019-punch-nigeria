Peter Dada Residents of Iwaro-Oka Akoko in Akoko South-West Local Government Area of Ondo State on Saturday took to the major street of the town, to protest against the incessant road accidents in the town, allegedly caused by trailers and trucks . The protesters called on the state government to stop heavy vehicles from plying their road, following the havoc allegedly being wreaked by the trailers on the road, which had led to the death of many residents of the town.

The Chairman of Iwaro Oka Community Union, Mr Dele Ologbese, who commented on the development , said the union decided to organise the protest due to the menace caused by heavy duty trucks.
