Hindi Livinus, Yola The Adamawa State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has faulted the delay by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri in constituting local government election petitions tribunals to handle petitions arising from the just concluded council polls in the state. Chairmanship and councillorship candidates of the APC had on Tuesday rejected the outcome of the polls. They lamented that despite the sham elections; the PDP government was delaying constituting election petition tribunals. The chairmanship candidate of the APC in Jada Local Government Area, Umar Hammajoda, who spoke for the aggrieved APC candidates, said the tribunals ought to have been constituted before the election. Hammanjoda accused the Fintiri-led PDP administration of stage managing flawed elections and at the same time deliberately trying to shut the door for aggrieved candidates to get justice. He said, “Let it be known that no council elections took place in all the 2,609 polling units of Adamawa State. “The Adamawa State Independent Electoral Commission denied the good people of this state the right to exercise their civic responsibility to vote for candidates of their choice to democratically manage the affairs of their local government areas. “The declaration by ADSIEC and issuance of certificates of return to 21 chairmanship candidates of the PDP and councillors as having won council election is gross injustice, violation of the electoral law, an illegality and therefore unacceptable to us, our party and its teeming supporters in the 21 local government areas of the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
