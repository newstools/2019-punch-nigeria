Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki The Ebonyi State High Court, sitting in Abakaliki, the state capital, on Monday, sentenced a woman, Mrs Agnes Nwefuru, to death by hanging for killing her co-wife and seven children. The state government had, in suit No HAW/13C/2017, brought against Nwefuru, accused her of setting ablaze the house of her co-wife, Felicia Nwefuru, which led to her death and that of her seven children. According to the police, the accused also burnt her own house during the evil act as a camouflage. The plaintiff further contended that the accused removed all her belongings and that of her children and took them to a safe place outside the house before committing the act. In 2017, eight members of a family were burnt to death following a mysterious fire that engulfed their residential house around 3am at Ogboji community in the Ishielu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State. Two persons were said to have survived the inferno – the husband, Mr Sylvanus Nwefuru, and Miss Ukamaka Nwefuru, one of late Felicia’s daughters. The fire razed the two thatched houses in the compound.
