Maiharaji Altine, Gusau The Upper Shari’a Court sitting in Gusau, Zamfara State, has adjourned the case of the alleged kidnapping and cattle rustling against a former commissioner, Ministry of Local Governments, Alhaji Bello Dankande Gamji, to December 30. The Presiding Judge,  Alhaji Abdulhadi Sani Gusau refused to grant bail to the accused person and ordered that he should be remanded in prison custody until the adjourned date. The Judge had also ruled that the court has jurisdiction to entertain the case contrary to the accused person’s counsel that the court has no power to hear the case.

Gamji had denied all the allegations. The court premises were filled to capacity, as hundreds of people were at the venue waiting to hear the court’s ruling on the charges against the former Commissioner.
