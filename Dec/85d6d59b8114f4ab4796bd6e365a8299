Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Arewa Youths Consultative Forum has accused the Lagos State Government of humiliating and carrying out indiscriminate arrest of northerners in Lagos. The group claimed that officials of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences were harassing commercial motorcyclists who were mainly northerners. The AYCF in a statement on Monday by its President, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, said the task force had been invading homes of northerners and taking away their motorcycles, warning that this might spark reprisals against southerners in the North. The group said, “We reliably gathered that using Gestapo style,  the Lagos Task Force officials have been invading homes of northerners in Lagos in ungodly hours of the night and carting away motorcycles while forcefully abducting the occupants and hauling them into detention.

It is even strange that this is coming from the South-West, a zone that expects the North to hand over the Presidency to it in 2023.” Shettima asked the Lagos State Government and the task force to explain the legal and constitutional basis for their action, noting that many northerners in Oshodi were harassed and arrested. He added, “We are deeply disturbed by this rather uncivilised conduct in the 21st century, happening in a supposedly cosmopolitan city like Lagos.” Copyright PUNCH.
