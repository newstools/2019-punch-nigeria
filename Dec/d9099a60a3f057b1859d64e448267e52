The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association has urged the Federal Government and Academic Staff Union of Universities to resolve their disagreement over the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System. The NECA Director General, Mr Timothy Olawale, told the News Agency of Nigeria on Saturday in Lagos that either party could initiate an industrial relations process to resolve the disagreements. “There are procedures to resolving disagreements in our Industrial Relations System, and either party can initiate the process. “The government and ASUU have their respective views and positions, which is quite understandable.

The NECA boss, while appreciating the importance of implementing IPPIS, said the government should consider the peculiarity of the university system. Olawale said, “This, therefore, calls for further consultations between both parties in order to resolve the issue.’’ He urged both parties to be guided by the labour laws in the unlikely event that dialogue broke down irretrievably. The NECA DG urged the parties to approach the National Industrial Court of Nigeria for a pronouncement to save the education sector from imminent industrial action. (NAN)
