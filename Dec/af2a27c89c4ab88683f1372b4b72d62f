Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa A suspected petty thief, Gift Clement, was on Thursday lynched and burnt to death by an angry mob at the Swali Market area of Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital. It was gathered that the 30-year-old Clement, who was an indigene of the Swali community, allegedly specialised in robbing traders and customers at gunpoint with members of his gang. But luck ran out on him when he and one of his gang members snatched the handbag of a lady and she raised the alarm. A mob was said to have descended on him, lynched and set him ablaze before a team of policemen could come to his rescue. However, his partner was said to have escaped. The incident happened barely two days after two kidnappers were burnt to death at Otuabula in Ogbia Local Government Area. An eyewitness, who gave his name as Paul Onyeka said the bandits had been tormenting residents within the Swali Market area. He said, “I saw people gathered. I saw one boy they caught with a gun around where they sell watermelon. Some policemen tried to rescue the boy but some group of boys refused. “The pressure was too much. Those bad boys have been tormenting people in the market everyday, robbing people of their monies and phones at gunpoint.” A trader in the market, who pleaded anonymity, said the hoodlums robbed traders and customers on a daily basis and attributed it to the “poor security situation” in the market area. She said, “They are two, but one of them has been killed. One managed to escape. Once it is 5 o’clock, everybody is running out of the market because they don’t want to be robbed at gunpoint. If you make a small sale of N2,000, you will be afraid because you don’t know whether you will take it home.” When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer of the Bayelsa State Police Command, Asinim Butswat, confirmed the incident.
