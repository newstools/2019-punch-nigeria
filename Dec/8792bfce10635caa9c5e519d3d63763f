James Abraham The Nigeria Export Promotion Council on Thursday expressed concern that the old and crude market penetration strategies were hindering the realisation of Nigeria’s zero oil economic plan initiative. The Chief Executive Officer of NEPC, Mr Olusegun Awolowo, who stated this in a keynote address  at a workshop in Jos, Plateau State,  noted that market access was one of the greatest constraints to small holder producers in Nigeria and other Third World countries. He explained that dynamism and sophistication in technology had affected all areas of human endeavours, stressing that business owners and other stakeholders in the export process must embrace digital marketing as a solution to the problem of low productivity and slow  growth to enable the country to realise its ambition to attain zero oil economic plan. Awolowo said, “One of the major strategic functions of the NEPC is to ensure that Nigeria’s exporters penetrate international market sustainably. The old and crude market penetration strategies are fast waning, giving way to technologically-driven strategies. Except we key into the modern day technology, the zero oil plan initiative ambition of the country may not be realisable.” He added, “You will realise that even some inconceivable products such as currencies are now traded electronically. It follows that within a short time, digital marketing could upstage physical market place. Hence, the urgent need for Nigerian business concerns to acquire appropriate skills that would make them to be visible globally.” Copyright PUNCH.
