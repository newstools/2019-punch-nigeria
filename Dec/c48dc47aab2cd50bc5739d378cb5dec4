Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja The Federal Government has frowned on China’s domination of the Nigerian mining sector, noting that the development had not helped the country’s economy. Chinese businessmen and firms, alongside other Asians, are the major players in the exploitation of solid minerals in the country, with Nigerian operators playing minor roles. The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite, made the observation on Monday at a workshop organised by the ministry in collaboration with the Lagos Business School, in Abuja. The minister pointed out that the Chinese exported unprocessed minerals from the country without adding any value to the commodities. Over 35 million metric tonnes of unprocessed solid minerals are reportedly exported from Nigeria each year. The minister said, “The dominance of China and other Asian countries in the Nigerian solid mineral sector has contributed little to the value chain in the sector. “China dominates mining in Nigeria with minimal roles for Nigerian firms.” Copyright PUNCH.
