Peter Dada, Akure An Ondo State Magistrates’ Court, sitting in Akure, the state capital, on Monday ordered for the remand of a police officer, Idowu Omosuyi, who allegedly killed a truck driver in Uso town, Owo Local Government Area of the state. The alleged killer cop, attached to the Federal Highway Patrol, allegedly shot the driver, Ado Saleh, at a police checkpoint on Akure-Owo Expressway at Uso last week Monday. The defendant was alleged to have shot the deceased in the head following an argument that ensued between them. The incident sparked a protest by other truck drivers and residents of the town, as they barricaded the expressway, demanding that the alleged killer policeman must be brought to book. On Monday, Omosuyi was brought before the magistrate court and was arraigned on one count of murder. According to the prosecution, the offence committed was contrary to section 316 and punishable under section 319 on the criminal laws of the Ondo State. The prosecutor, Inspector Goodluck Uloh, told the court that he had a motion on notice for the remand of the defendant in prison (Correctional Service Center). The counsel for the defendant, Mr Ikujuni Ademola, however, opposed the prosecutor’s application and prayed the court to order that the defendant be returned to the police custody. Giving the ruling, the magistrate, Mrs Charity Adeyanju, ordered that the defendant should be remanded in Olokuta Prison and adjourned the matter till December 27, 2019, for a hearing of the motion.
