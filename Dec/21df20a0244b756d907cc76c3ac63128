Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Government has asked finance and account officers in the state to ensure that the THEMES agenda of the administration reflect in their activities. The Commissioner for Finance in the state, Rabiu Olowo, gave the charge during a three-day retreat for the management staff of the ministry of finance. Olowo noted that the retreat was to ensure that finance and account officers keyed into government plans and promote a cordial relationship among all the finance officers from the ministry of finance, debt management office and state treasury office. According to Olowo, the retreat will define clear goals of the next fiscal year such that all the key players in the management of the state finance would understand their respective roles and take required actions respectively. He said, “The judicious use of the resources of the state is very vital in achieving each of the pillars of the governor’s developmental agenda as enunciated in the THEMES policy framework. The roles of finance cannot be overemphasised by any serious-minded government because every policy or decision made by the government come with its financial implications, thus making finance indispensable in achieving the goals of this present administration.” The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Ganiat Raji, noted that the retreat would provide an excellent opportunity to discuss emerging issues on ministerial responsibilities, exchange views on existing challenges and developmental perspectives.
