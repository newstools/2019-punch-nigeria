Adelani Adepegba, Abuja The Nigeria Christian Graduate Fellowship has dismissed a statement by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), urging Nigerians not to allow religion to divide the nation. The group said the President, had not before now, either in word or in deed, demonstrated that religion should not be a factor in national unity. This was contained in a statement by NCGF National President, Prof. Charles Adisa and General Secretary, Mr Onyenachi Nwaegeruo. The group said it was on record that “Mr President has effectively used the instrument of religion and ethnicity to gain unfair advantage in his quest for political power.” Accusing Buhari of hypocrisy, the NCGF in a statement in Abuja on Monday, said the President in his five years in the saddle had exhibited “the worst ethnic and religious bigotry in running the affairs of the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
