Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Minister of Interior and former Governor of Osun State, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, on Friday dismissed insinuations that he was at war with his successor, Adegboyega Oyetola. Aregbesola spoke in Osogbo during his recognition as the Amirul Waziril-Muminina by the Chief Imam of Osogbo, Sheik Musa Animasahun, at the Osogbo Central Mosque. Oyetola and many members of his cabinet were absent at the ceremony. There have also been insinuations that Oranmiyan, the political group of the ex governor , was not being given recognition in the present administration. But Aregbesola, who spoke in Yoruba language while addressing the gathering, explained that Oyetolaâ€™s inability to attend the event was due to his trip to Saudi Arabia for Ummrah. He said his relationship with Oyetola remained very healthy. He added that the renovation of the Osogbo Central Mosque was funded by the Osun State Government with inputs of the present governor, who was then the Chief of Staff to the Governor.
