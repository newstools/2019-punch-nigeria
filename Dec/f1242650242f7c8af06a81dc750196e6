Anna Okon The Nigerian Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers says it has commenced negotiations with Nexen Petroleum Limited over unpaid entitlements of its members. NUPENG General Secretary, Afolabi Olawale, said in a statement that the two parties had commenced discussions to address all industrial issues earlier raised. He commended the willingness of the management of Nexen Petroleum to adopt global best practices in industrial relations by engaging the union in a dialogue over workers’ conditions of service. “The union believes that the dialogue will go a long way in enhancing industrial peace, harmony and high productivity in the workplace,” Olawale stated. Recall that NUPENG had accused Nexen Petroleum of unfair labour practices over its refusal to negotiate with the union on collective bargaining agreement since 2010. Olawale in a letter had stated, “The union is disturbed over the secrecy surrounding the acquisition of Nexen Petroleum by China National Offshore Corporation and the purported plan by the company to leave the country with workers’ benefits.” In a related development, NUPENG has advised General Electric Plc to remit to its subsidiary, Arco Group Plc, outstanding over-deducted withholding tax to enable Arco to pay the severance package of all workers sacked since 2016. The NUPENG scribe warned that the endurance level of the union should not be overstretched and called on all relevant authorities to prevail on General Electric to do the needful “in order not to plunge the nation into avoidable industrial crisis.” Copyright PUNCH.
