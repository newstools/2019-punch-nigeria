Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja The National Identity Management Commission has warned that the country’s National Identity Programme will not succeed without strong political will on the part of government. The Director-General of NIMC,  Aliyu Aziz, who spoke at the General Assembly of the Northern Traditional Rulers Council in Kaduna, also stressed that the programme would fail if it did not receive adequate funding. In a paper entitled ‘Importance of national identity to nation building’, Aziz said, “Without strong political leadership and commitment, financial resources and stakeholder collaboration, the National Identity Programme will not be successful and sustained. “Like any government reform, political will and strong leadership are required to implement the national identity project.” NIMC, which is coordinating the identity programme, has so far enrolled about 38 million Nigerians for the National Identification Number Project. Aziz disclosed that NIMC had been facing some challenges in its efforts to enrol Nigerians for the NIN. The challenges, according to him, include poor funding, inadequate mobilisation and limited awareness. He urged the royal fathers to help in creating awareness for the programme, and assist in mobilising their subjects to enable them to enrol for the identity number. A successful implementation of the identity programme would grow and further modernise Nigeria’s economy, Aziz noted. Copyright PUNCH.
