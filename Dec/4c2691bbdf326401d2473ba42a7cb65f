Gibson Achonu, Owerri The National Library of Nigeria says it has drafted a National Publishing Standard for publishing books in the country to be ratified soon by stakeholders. This, according to the establishment, was in addition to the acquisition and deployment of more utility vehicles to its zonal offices to smoothen the collection of legal deposit materials. The National Librarian, Prof. Lanre Aina, disclosed this at a two-day sensitisation workshop on “Legal Deposit Compliances and International Standard Serial Number/International Standard Book Number  in South East/South South zonal session” organised by the National Library of Nigeria in Owerri, the Imo State capital. According to Aina, the effort was also being periodically supported with the placement of advertisements in all major newspapers in the country on the need for legal deposit compliance and adherence to publishing standards by authors and publishers. Aina boasted that the National Library of Nigeria was no longer where it used to be in the collection of legal deposit and compliance with international publishing standards, as, according to him, it had in the past few years, recorded a significant increase on the number of materials received as legal deposits and ISBN/ ISSN assigned to publications. Aside the objective  of legal deposit collection, Aina said, “The sensitisation activities are being focused on adherence to publishing standards through the obtaining of International Standard Book Number for books, monographic, reports among others and International Standard Serial Number for journals, newspapers, magazines by all categories  of producers of publications.” CopyrightPUNCH.
