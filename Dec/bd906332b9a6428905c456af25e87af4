Nigeria national team defender, William Ekong, has started a campaign to draw attention to neglected tropical diseases that reportedly affect more than 120 million Nigerians. The campaign involves the trio of the Federal Ministry of Health, and two international nongovernmental agencies — The END Fund and the Common Goal. A press release distributed by the African Media Agency on behalf of the END Fund states, “In partnership with the END Fund and Common Goal, William [Ekong] appears in a public service announcement where he calls on affected Nigerians to seek free treatment.” The statement notes that neglected tropical diseases are “a group of parasitic and bacterial infectious diseases that affect more than 1.7 billion of the world’s most impoverished people, including 1 billion children.” Continuing, it states that such neglected tropical diseases “include intestinal worms, schistosomiasis (bilharzia), river blindness, trachoma, and lymphatic filariasis.” The message, which is also translated in pidgin, Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba, states that the public service announcement sheds light on how NTDs affect all aspects of life. Ekong calls upon Nigerians to “take advantage of the ongoing mass administration of medication efforts being led by community health workers all throughout the country.” “Please, visit your local health centre for more information on how to get treatment in your local government area in Nigeria,” the statement admonishes.
