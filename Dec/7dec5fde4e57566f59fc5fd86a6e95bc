Success Nwogu, Abuja The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance in the last governorship election in Zamfara State, Alhaji Sani Shinkafi, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to caution a former governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari, and the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan. Shinkafi, in a statement made available to journalists in Abuja on Monday, accused Yari of planning to destabilise the peace in the state and allegedly using the leadership of the National Assembly. He said the people of the state would resist every attempt by Yari and his agents to bring back the dark days when armed robbery, cattle rustling and kidnapping were the order of the day in the state. He said, “It was with a great shock that I saw the letter written by the Senate Committee Chairman on Police Affairs, Senator Haliru  Jika, inviting the miraculous, wonderful, courageous, workaholic Commissioner of Police, Zamfara State, who joined hands with our peace-loving governor to initiate peace by using conflict management mechanism.” According to Shinkafi, the letter to the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, shows that inviting the Zamfara State Commissioner of Police is a ploy to destabilise the peace we are enjoying in the state. He added, “We are calling on Mr President, Muhammadu Buhari, who is charged by the constitution to protect lives and properties to caution Yari. Enough is enough! “We are calling on Mr President to caution the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, as nobody should use the upper chamber to cause problems, because Yari has been bragging that he is the sole sponsor of Lawan as Senate President and also the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila.” Copyright PUNCH.
