While emphasising the ethics of the journalism profession, Falana demanded “an apology from the media aides of the President, for playing on the collective intelligence of Nigerians through false statements issued on the invasion of the court by the men of the DSS. This is because the DSS has apologised to the Judge on the incident.” The human rights activist while congratulating the awardees also urged them to keep up the good work. “We must ensure we fight injustice until it is over in our country. “I will also urge us all, particularly journalists, not to peddle rumours in their quest to fight injustice,” he said
