Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri Governorship candidate of the Action Alliance in Imo State during the 2019 general elections, Uche Nwosu, said he would support any candidate who emerges winner at the Supreme Court. He said he no longer harbours grudges against those who truncated his governorship ambition. Nwosu, who spoke to journalists at Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri, said he had put behind him the recent Supreme Court judgment which disqualified him from the state’s governorship race on account of dual nominations by the Action Alliance and All Progressives Congress. Nwosu, a son-in-law to the immediate-past governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha, said his major interest was for the people of the state to have access to quality leadership and dividends of democracy, noting that he would support any of the candidates who is adjudged winner of the election by the apex court.
