Raphael Ede, Enugu The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnanya Onu, on Monday appealed to members of the All Progressives Congress in Enugu and South -East in general not to relent in their support for the President, Major General Muhammadu  Buhari (retd.), and the party at all  levels. Onu said though members of the party in the state and the region had been undergoing tough time as opposition party, he expressed optimism that they would smile when their party took over power in the zone. “As an opposition party in the state, our members are facing some tough time, which I strongly believe will be over in no distant time,” the minister said. Onu, who spoke while addressing members of the Enugu State Executive Council of the party at the state Secretariat, thanked party faithful in the state for their continued support for the party and the President, urging them not to relent. Addressing journalists, Enugu State chairman of the party, Dr Ben Nwoye, thanked the minister for the visit, describing him as a true leader and man of the people. Nwoye regretted that some people who got appointment because the APC won election had abandoned the party faithful. “This man came here all the way from Abuja. He is a true Nigerian; he came in here, spent time with the party despite his very tight schedule and encouraged us. And because he has always supported us, Enugu State will always stand by him,” he said. CopyrightPUNCH.
