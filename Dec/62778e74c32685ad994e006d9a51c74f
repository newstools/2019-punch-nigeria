Ted Odogwu, Kano Tragedy struck in Kano on Wednesday when a policemanr attached to the Stanbic IBTC Bank was alleged to have opened fire on a man identified as Mus’ab Sammani, killing him in the process. The incident occurred at the bank’s branch on the Niger Avenue by the Mallam Kato Square, off Post Office Road in the commercial city. It was gathered that the deceased and a tricycle operator were engaged in a heated argument as the tricycle brushed his car. It was learnt that the policeman abandoned his duty post to intervene in the argument so as not to degenerate into a fisticuff. The policeman reportedly ordered the motorist to take his car out of the scene and park it on the other side of the road, but while carrying out the instruction, the cop thought that the deceased wanted to escape and pulled the trigger of his gun in an attempt to threaten Sammani. However, a stray bullet allegedly pierced the windscreen of the car and hit Sammani in the neck. The spokesman for the command, DSP Abdullahi Haruna, said the deceased was rushed to the Mallam Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital but he was pronounced dead on arrival. Haruna added that the killer policeman had been arrested and investigation had since commenced to unravel the circumstances behind the incident. Copyright PUNCH.
