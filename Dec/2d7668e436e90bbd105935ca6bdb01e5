Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons and other related offences has said that it was able to secure the conviction of 23 sexual offenders in the country in 2019. The agency added that a total of 749 cases of sexual abuses, trafficking and others were reported to NAPTIP during the year, many of which were still undergoing prosecution. The NAPTIP Director-General, Julie Okah-Donli, stated these on Friday in Abuja at an end-of-the-year press conference, noting that a total of 538 suspects were also arrested. The DG said, “We have established State task forces in five states so that we can get more reports from Nigerians. You recall hundreds of Nigerians who were rescued from various detention centres in the country. We have harped on the need to rehabilitate them first before reuniting them with their family members. We have shelters and are able to do that and this is why we are building synergy with the police. “In 2019, 749 cases were reported to us while 523 suspects were arrested by NAPTIP. The cases won were 16 and the convicted persons were 23. We rescued 876 victims during the year.” On the Sexual Offenders’ Register, the DG stated that Nigerians would have full access by 2020 and would be able to do background checks on the workers they bring in. “There are two sections in the register which are those who have been convicted and those who are still undergoing prosecution. It is useful for Nigerians to check before they employ houseboys, schoolteachers and other categories of workers,” she added. Copyright PUNCH.
