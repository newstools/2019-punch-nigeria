The Managing Director, Belefull kitchen, Mojisola Ogunsanya, has said running a successful business in Nigeria is quite demanding and tough. She advised everyone running a business in Nigeria to have a ‘shock absorber’, noting that “the clime of running business in this country is very challenging.” The chef said this at the launch of “Belefull Varieties” in Lagos. She also bemoaned the epileptic state of power supply in the country, which according to her posed a serious constraint to business growth, thereby, affecting productivity. Ogunsanya said, “Energy is the biggest challenge most Nigerian business suffer from. Imagine if the national grid was to provide electricity for 24 hours, productivity will increase and it will impact positively on our economy. But right now, we spend a lot of money on generator, buying diesel on a daily basis and it’s not cheap.” She advised entrepreneurs in Nigeria to stick to their passion and kick against franchising their business, noting that franchise had killed most thriving businesses in the country. She said, “Most restaurant businesses are recording drop in sales and some are faced with extinction due to franchise issue. I advise that when you are franchising, you must have a stake in your business because most people that bid for franchise might not have the vision or passion you have but just to make money.”
