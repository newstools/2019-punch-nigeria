Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Ministry of Transportation has commenced the removal of some roundabouts identified as major causes of gridlock being experienced by motorists in the state. The state Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who went to inspect the removal of the Lekki 2nd roundabout, said his administration was committed to ridding the state of gridlock. Sanwo-Olu, who urged the contractors handling the projects to keep up with the current pace of work so as to ensure their completion in record time, said the removal of the roundabouts and street furniture, such as giant billboards, would give room for road expansion and strategically ease traffic congestion in some parts of the metropolis.
