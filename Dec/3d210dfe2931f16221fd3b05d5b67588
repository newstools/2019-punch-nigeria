Okechukwu Nnodim The Nigerian Association for Energy Economics is disturbed by the poor power supply situation in Nigeria and wants prompt and effective remedial actions from the Federal Government to avert a collapse of the sector. NAEE’s President, Yinka Omorogbe, who made the call on behalf of the body during the association’s First Abuja Technical Forum, stated that Nigerians were suffering terribly in terms of power supply. She urged the Federal Government to not only improve the power sector, but also strengthen the industry to ensure sustainable supply of electricity to every Nigerian. Omorogbe also noted that affordable and reliable energy had been a global concern, which was the reason for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 that focused on ensuring affordable energy for all. She said, “This, of course, is one major reason for this meeting, as it seeks to positively impact on the energy sector in Nigeria. “This sector is currently not in a good situation and we want to make sure that whatsoever we discuss is going to be made available to the policymakers.” The Managing Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company, Chiedu Ugbo, stated that the issue of electricity was very critical as Nigeria since 1999 had been battling with the challenges associated with the energy sector. Ugbo recalled that in 1999 the average installed capacity in terms of electricity was 5,800 megawatts. He stated that out of the installed capacity, only 2,300MW was available to be utilised, indicating that about 2,500MW could not be used. He, however, noted that Nigeria had been able to increase its power production figures over the years, both in terms of installed and generation capacities. CopyrightPUNCH.
