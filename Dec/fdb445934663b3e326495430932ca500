Ife Ogunfuwa Nigeria’s export to the United States under the African Growth and Opportunity Act policy has declined, recording $4.36m in 2018. According to the latest  AGOA trade statistics,  exports to the US under the policy fell by 25 per cent from $5.808bn in 2017 to $4.358bn in 2018. The data indicated that oil export under the policy continued to take the centre stage, accounting for 99.9 per cent of the AGOA exports to the United States in 2018. Oil and gas products valued at $4.354bn were exported to the US under the policy in 2018. Nigeria energy export to the United States under the policy boosted trade balance between the two countries, creating a trade surplus of $2.95bn in 2018. In the same year, exporters of chemical products, agro-products, minerals and metals, enjoyed the duty-free trade deal. Chemical products valued at $226,000 were exported to the US, agricultural products worth $4.32m, forest  products valued at $18,000, minerals and metals worth $10,000 and other products valued at $1,000 were also exported. Textile and apparel export was worth $1,000, footwear valued at $1,000 and machinery valued at $6,000 were exported in 2018. Overall, the total non-oil export under AGOA in Nigeria was $4.58m in 2018, indicating  33 per cent reduction from $6.857m  recorded in 2017. Nigeria led other countries that benefitted from the tariff-free export opportunity last year in the Economic Community of West African States sub-region. The AGOA, a United States’ trade policy, enacted in 2000, is a legislation that facilitates trade between exporters from sub-Saharan Africa and the United States duty-free. After much clamour from the beneficiary countries, the export opportunity, after completing its initial 15-year validity period, was extended in 2015 by another 10 years. This means that Nigeria and 42 other countries which met the eligibility criteria will benefit from the tariff-free opportunity till 2025. The Regional Coordinator of the NEPC, (South-West), Mr Babatunde Faleke, who spoke  at a stakeholders event recently, noted that there had not been an appreciably export of Nigerian foods to the US under AGOA despite the certification given to exporters. “We have to do things right. NEPC is committed to ensuring performance of exporters in a formal and ideal way, hence this roundtable meeting,” he added. Copyright PUNCH.
