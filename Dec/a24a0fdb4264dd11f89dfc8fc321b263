Patrick Odey,Uyo The Akwa Ibom State Government on Thursday refuted reports that it slashed salaries of newly recruited medical doctors. It said the delay was caused by error in calculation of the affected officers’ salaries. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Dominic Ukpong, in an interview with our correspondent said, the civil service decided to place the affected officers on Consolidated Akwa Ibom State Salary Scale since there was no accreditation for them at the time. He said, “Akwa Ibom State did not have House Officers training until 2016 because there were no accommodation and no consultants to train them; these are the basic requirements for the training of House Officers. “But we came in 2015 and re-established all these and provided accommodation in Eket, Oron and Ikot-Ekpene and also hired consultants. “During this period, the House Officers had to be on salary but because their salary was not accommodated in the Consolidated Medical Salary Scale which applies to doctors, the state decided to pay them allowance called Consolidated Akwa Ibom State Salary Scale. “If you look at the calculation of these salaries, there is a big difference from the other salary scale.” He said the affected officers were supposed to have earned the salary but apparently from the civil service, the calculation was not done and they earned the salary in error. The commissioner added, “Normally, what happened when we have House Officers, we send the names to the civil service and the money is calculated and paid to them.” Copyright PUNCH.
