The Lagos State Government says it will demolish buildings obstructing government’s Right of Way (RoW) at Lekki in Eti-Osa Local Government Area. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu disclosed this during a road assessment on Saturday in Lekki, saying  that people had built structures without planning approval, thereby obstructing government’s RoW. Sanwo-Olu said that houses built on the RoW and obstructions on the alignment of the Lekki Regional Road were the major causes of flooding around Lekki axis. He said that the Lekki regional road was meant to be a relief access road for the Lekki-Epe express road. “We have gone round and have seen  that there are places where the alignments are still kept, and people still kept the planning approval of the state government. “But a major place of concern is where people have completely bastardised the Right of Way, where people have built structures around the place, without approval. “We are going to instruct the Ministry of Physical Planning to come and ask for their planning approvals. The ones that do not have, we will mark all those buildings for demolition. “We want to also engage them because we will need to ask them what other alternatives they want to give us,” he said. The governor said that building on RoW showed a high level of irresponsibility by citizens and disregard for the state’s urban planning masterplan. According to him, government will not condone it or sit back and let people take undue advantage of the state’s planning laws. (NAN)
