Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri Governor Babagana Umara of Borno State has said there is no plan to ban Keke NAPEP operators in the state. But he said there was the need to regulate the operation of commercial tricycles for efficiency and to combat insecurity. The governor made the clarification on Tuesday against the backdrop of rumours that the state government was planning to ban commercial tricycle, popularly called Keke NAPEP in the state. The governor, who addressed about 200 operators of commercial tricycles at the Borno State Government Secretariat in Maiduguri, said he called the meeting to clarify government’s stand on their operation. He said, “We intend to strictly regulate the influx of Keke NAPEP into Borno State, we intend to thoroughly establish the identities of those who own and operate these Keke NAPEP and issue regulatory identification numbers to every Keke NAPEP and operator. “How could I have contemplated the ban when government has not provided alternative transport and means of livelihoods for the operators? We all know that no amount of taxis and buses can replace the convenience Keke NAPEP affords residents because of comfortability and ruggedness that make them access every location.” CopyrightPUNCH.
