The founder of One Love Family, Satguru Maharaj Ji, has recommended 20 years jail term for parents of children involved in cultism. He spoke in Ibadan on Friday at a news conference at his Maharaj Ji village to herald activities marking his 72nd birthday and 40th spiritual birthday. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Maharaj Ji, the self-acclaimed “living perfect master” and prince of the Akinbami ruling dynasty of the Olubadan of Ibadanland, was born on December 20, 1947. While bemoaning the incidence of cultism in schools, he said, “Mr President should enact an executive order stipulating death sentence for those involved in cultism to save our youths. “Also, family heads whose wards/children engage in cult activities in schools should be sentenced to 20 years imprisonment without option of fine.” Maharaj Ji, however, lamented the hardship being faced by some workers after retirement, calling on the Federal Government to investigate the Pension Commission and restore the old pension system with the accompanying gratuity.

Maharaj Ji stressed the need for the government to initiate steps for the creation of state and local government police to be funded by 10 percent of the national budget. NAN quoted Maharaj Ji as calling for the removal of religion and tribe categories from all forms for employment, adding that “sex workers in the country should be drafted into national farms, police or army to serve the nation.” He urged the police to discharge their duties proactively and in accordance with the law, urging them to adhere strictly to government’s zero tolerance for corruption and all kinds of criminal activities.
