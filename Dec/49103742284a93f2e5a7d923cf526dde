Embattled activist and presidential candidate of the African Action Congress in the February 2019 general election, Mr. Omoyele Sowore, has said that Nigeria belongs to every Nigerian and that no Nigerian should be afraid in their own country. Sowore spoke at the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Friday as the operatives of the Department of State Services rearrested him inside the court. Sowore was released around 7.20pm on Thursday after he had spent 125 days in the DSS detention since his arrest last August when he was accused of planning a forceful takeover of government through nationwide protests tagged #RevolutionNow. However, on Friday, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court in Abuja abruptly suspended sitting and fled her court as the DSS operatives invaded the courtroom and re-arrested Sowore, less than 24 hours after his release from illegal custody. Speaking to supporters and family members who witnessed his re-arrest in court premises on Friday, Sowore said, “Every Nigerian must benefit from a country that’s theirs’. “They tried to break me in prison. They sent delegations to me, offering all kinds of… and I refused. “And they promised that I will not walk out of their detention alive. That’s what they came here (in the court) to implement today. “Nobody in Nigeria should be afraid. It’s our country and some people have to make the sacrifice for this country to be a country of rule, of law…” See the viral video:
