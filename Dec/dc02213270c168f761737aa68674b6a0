Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The All Progressives Congress in Bayelsa State on Sunday called on the state governor, Seriake Dickson, to stop heating up the polity with “wild allegations and inciting comments.” The APC in a statement by the state Publicity Secretary, Doifie Buokoribo, noted that Dickson had been issuing threats and raising tension following the defeat of his candidate at the just-concluded governorship election. The party was responding to what it described as “successions of claims by Dickson after the loss of the Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate, Senator Douye Diri, at the November 16 governorship election in the state.” The APC admonished the governor to toe the path of democracy and the rule of law by taking his grievances to the courts. The statement read, “In the last few weeks, since the overwhelming victory of our candidate, Chief David Lyon, at the November 16 governorship election, Governor Seriake Dickson has inundated the state and, indeed, the country with wild allegations and inciting comments. “He has screamed blue murder at all relevant institutions of state, from the electoral body to the security agencies, and the winning All Progressives Congress. And he has absolved only himself and his section of the Peoples Democratic Party of blame. “From his furious mind, Dickson has issued threats to the electorate in Bayelsa State and APC members, particularly, and he has boasted about his capacity to unleash violence and turn the state upside down. “Dickson has displayed everything, but commitment to democratic ideals and legal processes of electoral conflict resolution.” Copyright PUNCH.
