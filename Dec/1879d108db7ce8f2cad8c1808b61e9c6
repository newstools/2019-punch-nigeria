Anna Okon youth-centric professional group, Global Interns, has collaborated with telecommunications giant, Airtel Nigeria, to organise special skill development training for youths. Tagged ‘Training for Employability Skills,’ a programme under Global Interns’ Career Connect series, the exercise was designed to provide graduates with the knowledge and soft skills to prepare them for the workplace. The organisers noted that this was necessary because more employers sought versatile skills from entry-level employees. During the two- day training, participants learned from certified and experienced trainers on topics like proficiency in digital skills, self-management skills, introduction to analytical skills, communication and reasoning skills as well as writing a resume. The Principal Adviser to Global Interns, Olufunmilayo Modupe, said that the organisation started in 2016 as a mediator agency connecting students to internship jobs and career development opportunities. This, she said had broadened into offering training for soft skill with a goal to making youths versatile for today’s workplace while also increasing internship and job placements. She commended Airtel Nigeria for supporting the Global Interns Training alongside partners like HR Analytica, Hamilton and Lloyds and FutureSoft who were on ground to assess and engage the trainees.
