The CG, who also received an award presented to him by the Interior Minister, represented by Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Mrs Georgina Ekeoma-Ehuria said, “We have been operating with visas that did not target our economic growth, that does not look at our security situation, that is not very transparent.” “I assure you, it (new e-visa) will be transparent, it will remove cash payment and ensure no security is compromised. It’s a balance between facilitation and transparency and protection of national security,” Babandede added. The CG explained that the award night was meant to reward diligent officers and encourage them to put in their best in the New Year, noting that those who were indicted for corrupt activities or misconduct during the year were sanctioned. He stated, “We have dismissed many officers in 2019 for corruption and for absenteeism. We have reduced the ranks of many officers, some of them are still under investigations for taking money from applicants and ordinary Nigerians who want to get service which was supposed to be free.”
