Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Senate on Wednesday amended the Public Procurement Act 2007 and increased mobilisation of local contractors from 15 to 30 per cent. The upper chamber also reduced the time frame for contract award to two weeks for processing and four days to issue certificates to qualified contractors. Many senators during the consideration of the report argued that the current mobilisation fee for local contractors was inadequate and that it usually led to contracts abandonment. The issue of certificate of no objection generated an interesting debate among the senators when the amendments were being discussed. Most of those who spoke on the matter were divided over whether the certificate should be issued by heads of the MDAs or a special committee in the Bureau of Public Procurement. The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, noted that the parliament should ensure that there was no delay in contract processing and award by giving a time frame for the necessary document to be issued. He said doing so was also a better way to avoid corruption. The members after much debate agreed to use the issue of time frame as a means of saving time and stopping corruption in contracts award. They agreed that contracts should be processed within two weeks while the certificate issued within four days. The Senate did not fix any percentage as mobilisation fee for foreign contractors because some senators argued that they should be ready to use their money for projects and get paid afterwards.
