Simon Utebor The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has urged young couples to always seek advice from exemplary persons. Buhari gave the advice while congratulating President of the Senate, Dr Ahmed Lawan, on his son’s marriage. Ibrahim, son of the Senate President, got married to Amani, the daughter of a businessman, Alhaji Bala Umar, a Kano indigene, in Kano on Friday. In a message to the event, Buhari advised the newly-wedded couple to emulate the life of the Senate President whom he described as “balanced”. A statement by Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja, quoted him as saying, “If you’re looking for some advice on life, relating to any aspect, you have to focus and learn from those with good examples. “A good example to learn from is Senator Lawan. In politics and life, he embodies many good virtues.’’ The marriage ceremony began on Wednesday with the bridal shower or Kamu in Hausa, followed by a dinner on Thursday. Both events held at Meena Event Centre in Kano. The climax of the event was the Wedding Fatiah which held on Friday at the popular Al Furquan Mosque, GRA, Kano. It was like a parade of who-is-who in Nigeria’s politics at the wedding which was conducted by the Chief Imam of the mosque, Bashir Sadaki. The Minister of Communications, Dr Isa Ali Pantami, at the ceremony, gave out in marriage Amani while the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Bala Buni, received the bride. Members of the red chamber led by the Senate Leader, Dr Yahaya Abdullahi and the green Chamber, led by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, registered their presence in large number apparently as a show of solidarity to the Senate President.
