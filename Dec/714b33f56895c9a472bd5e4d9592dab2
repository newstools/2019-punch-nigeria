Raphael Ede The Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev Callistus Onaga, has described as difficult the process of building a church in the Northern part of Nigeria, especially in the North-East and North-West. Onaga also criticised the Federal Government for allegedly encouraging religious intolerance in Nigeria, saying the United States had its facts right when it placed Nigeria on the watch list of religious intolerant countries. In an interview with our correspondent, the Catholic bishop said to build a church in the North “is like a camel passing through the eyes of the needle.” “To build a church in the Northern part, especially in the North-East and North-West, you will do a lot of sacrifices and at times telling white lies in, whereas coming down here (in the South), you can always build a mosque wherever you want,” he said. The cleric said the problem of insecurity in Nigeria revolved round religious intolerance. “Let there be religious tolerance. Before the US make any assertions, they must have accessed and gathered their information,” he said. Copyright PUNCH.
