Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has called on the Central Bank of Nigeria to sanction commercial banks that use casual staff to run their critical operations. The call followed the unanimous adoption of a motion moved by Amobi Akintola at the plenary on Wednesday. Adopting the motion, the lawmakers called on commercial banks “to convert their casual staff who are handling core operations to permanent staff without further delay.” They urged the CBN “to sanction any bank that fails to comply.” The House also mandated the Committees on Banking and Currency; and Labour, Employment and Productivity to interface with banks “on the need to stop casualisation of their core operational staff.” Moving the motion, Akintola recalled that prior to the emergence of new generation banks in Nigeria, staff of banks were usually made up of full-time workers who were entitled to series of benefits from the banks they worked for. He said the benefits included promotion, health package, productivity, life insurance policy, housing allowance, wardrobe allowance, feeding allowance, among others, which made banking jobs enviable. He said that the House was also concerned that core operations of banks like were being handled by contract staff. Copyright PUNCH.
