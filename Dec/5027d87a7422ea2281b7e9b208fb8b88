Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Adewale Akanbi, has urged those judging him over his crash marriage to his  Jamaican wife, Chanel Chin, to seek the truth or face repercussions. The royal father in a statement said he had forgiven those who had judged him without hearing his side of the story. The statement partly reads, “Regarding his marital issues now, I have this to say to you… if I ever did evil or show anything other than love in this my immediate past union, let God Almighty judge me and put the curse on my head and remove the crown from me. “But if I’m righteous enough in this marriage, may God let me reign for long and always overcome all adversaries and calamities that may come my way.
