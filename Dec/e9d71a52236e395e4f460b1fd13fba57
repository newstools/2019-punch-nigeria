Alada noted that there was an extraordinary imbalance of power between the service providers and the consumers. According to him, the goal of consumer protection is to mitigate this power imbalance. The director said that one of the roles of the department in the bank was to entrench fair and responsible practices among financial service providers through regulations. He, however, called on bank customers to report any financially-related complaints to the CBN anytime they were dissatisfied with responses from their banks. (NAN)
