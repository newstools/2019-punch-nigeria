Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The acting Director-General of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, Capt. Abdullahi Sidi, says the absence of adequate perimeter fencing at Bayelsa airport has been preventing the regulatory authority from certifying to begin operations. Sidi stated that it was mandatory for every airport to have perimeter fencing, which could be solid wall with a buffer and sharp fence to stop unwanted movement into the airport environment. The Bayelsa State Government opened the over N60bn airport, known as Bayelsa International Airport, in February with an inaugural flight by the state Governor, Seriake Dickson, from Abuja, followed by an Air Peace flight from Lagos. However, the airport has not been operating since the inaugural flights. Sidi, who is also the Director of Operations and Training, NCAA, told journalists that stakeholders resolved not to compromise on security and safety at the airport. According to him, the regulatory agency will issue the certificate for the commencement of flight operations as soon as the issue of perimeter fencing was resolved. He said, “Perimeter fencing is number one requirement for any airport, which is safety. “Someone said the government had done about 60 per cent of the perimeter fencing and said the other side of the airport was creek, but I say that is not acceptable to aviation industry. “We have what we call the airside and the passenger side of an airport. The airside is supposed to be much more secured than the passenger side.” Copyright PUNCH.
