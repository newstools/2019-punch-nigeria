Afeez Hanafi A tanker loaded with 33,000 litres of petrol on Saturday went up in flames on Otedola Bridge, Berger end of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The General Manager, Lagos Emergency Management Agency, Dr Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, said the tanker, with the number plate KJA 900 XR, had a tyre bust while in motion, resulting in a spark that ignited the fire. He stated that a joint emergency response team of LASEMA and Lagos State Fire Service responded promptly to put out the fire. He said, “Investigation revealed that the tanker had a busted tyre while on motion and led to an outbreak of fire due to heat generated by the motion. “No casualty or injury was recorded. Firefighters were on the ground to prevent the occurrence of a secondary accident.” There had been incidences of tanker fire on the bridge with the major one that occurred in June 2018, leaving many dead and destroying several vehicles.
