Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The House of Representatives Committee on Aviation has called for more funding to improve the management of the country’s airspace. The Chairman of the committee, Nnolim Nnaji, said the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency had many ongoing projects to improve navigation and needed more funding. Nnaji made this known on Wednesday during an oversight visit and inspection of navigational aids at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. Nnaji also stated that there was a need to amend the NAMA Act, saying that it would help the agency to conform to modern standards and practices. The Managing Director of NAMA, Capt. Fola Akinkuotu, urged the committee to look into some of the agency’s challenges by enabling laws that would improve safety. Copyright PUNCH.
