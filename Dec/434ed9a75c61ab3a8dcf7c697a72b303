Tunde Ajaja A former United States Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, has said that the re-arrest of the convener of the RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore, and the invasion of the Federal High Court in Abuja has already damaged the country’s international reputation. In his post on the website of the Council on Foreign Relations, Campbell said the court invasion and Sowore’s re-arrest was a dent on the country’s image abroad. He said, “The SSS (DSS) assault on a courtroom and the re-arrest of Sowore has already damaged the country’s international reputation.” Campbell, who was the US ambassador to Nigeria between May 12, 2004 and July 19, 2007, also cited PUNCH’s editorial, titled, ‘Buhari’s lawlessness: Our Stand’, saying, “During the period of military rule, Punch was known for its democratic and human rights activism. The military closed it three times and imprisoned its editor and deputy editor. It remains to be seen how the Buhari government will respond.” CopyrightPUNCH.
