Ted Odogwu, Kano The Kano State Executive Council on Monday approved the Emirate Council Bill 2019, which provides for the establishment of additional emirates in the state. With this development, the council has endorsed the establishment of four new Emirates comprising, Rano, Gaya, Bichi and Karaye and has forwarded same to the state House of Assembly for necessary action. A statement by the Commissioner for Information, Mallam Muhammad Garba, at the end of the council session, indicated that some of the emirates pre-dated Kano, just as the effort to revive them during the Second Republic was short-lived. He said council discussed the decade-long clamour for the establishment of additional emirates in the state, with a view to bringing more development to the people of the new emirates. The commissioner also explained that the exercise was informed by the need to bring traditional institution closer to the people in addition to facilitating speedy socio-economic development and security in the state. The commissioner pointed out that the Emirate Council Bill 2019 was amended in the public interest, following a Kano High Court action, which nullified the law on the grounds that the petition was presented to the assembly by a private person, who is not a member of the House.
