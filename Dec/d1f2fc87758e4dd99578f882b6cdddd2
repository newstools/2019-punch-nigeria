Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi with agency report A private jet belonging to a yet-to-be-identified Nigerian was on Tuesday seized by the United States Federal agents at Peachtree DeKalb Airport, Atlanta Georgia. According to WSB-TV, the jet belongs to a Nigerian national charged in a multimillion-dollar international fraud scheme. The WSB-TV reporter, who posted a video from the scene of the seizure on his Twitter handle, had tweeted, “We’re alongside federal agents as they seize a jet at @PDKAirport.” The channel said investigators collected evidence from the plane and a K-9 team swept it for drugs and other contraband.
