’Femi Asu The delay in taking the final investment decision on the Train 7 of the Nigeria LNG Limited is holding up other projects that could provide feedstock to the facility, a new report has said. The Train 7 project will increase the NLNG’s production capacity by 35 per cent from 22 metric tonnes per annum to 30 MTPA, according to the company. The African Energy Chamber, in its African Energy Outlook 2020, said, “There is growing momentum in Nigerian gas but delays in the FID on the Train 7 liquefaction facility is holding up other projects which could provide feedstock to the facility, for example Shell’s offshore OML 77. “However, following FID in December 2018, Shell’s onshore Assa North Gas Project could add up to 600 million standard cubic feet per day once fully developed, with the capacity to expand to 1.2 billion scf/d (around 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day).” According to the report, as of the end of first half of 2019, there were 46 oil projects under development across sub-Saharan Africa. It said, “Nine of these are planned (that is reached FID), the rest have been announced, with varying prospects for reaching the FID in the near term. Nigeria accounts for half of all these projects, with Angola being the second most active market, followed by Chad. “A combined total of $17bn worth of capital expenditure has been committed to the planned projects. The largest of these is the Anyala Madu fields offshore Nigeria, at a cost of $4.41bn and due to come on stream in 2020. In the Republic of Congo, the Banga Kayo project is of a similar scale ($4.37bn), with funding from Chinese investors.” The report stated that Nigeria would lead the way in terms of upstream expenditure as the continent’s largest producer. According to the AEC, five of the projects that have reached the FID are in Nigeria with a total capex value of $6.1bn. It noted that Total’s Egina deepwater field came on stream at the beginning of 2019 and had boosted crude production by nearly 10 per cent (just over 200,000 barrels per day). It said, “The development of the offshore Anyala (OML 83) and Madu (OML 85) fields has been slower than expected – they will come on-stream in 2020. At their peak, the fields are expected to yield 50,000 bpd and 120 million standard cubic feet per day respectively. “The FID for the Bonga South-West project is expected by 2022, with production starting in 2024. The field could add 225,000bpd at peak flow.” CopyrightPUNCH.
