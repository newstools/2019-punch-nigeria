Peter Dada, Akure Two men were reportedly killed in separate incidents in Ondo State on Monday by gunmen. The deceased were a security guard, Mr Jimoh Teloye, and a retired school principal, Mr Christopher Karigidi. According to a source, Teloye was a night guard employed by some shop owners in Ikare Akoko, the headquarters of the Akoko North-East Local Government Area of the state, and his lifeless body was found on Monday morning. The source said, “Shop owners behind the central mosque got to their shops this morning (Monday) and met the man on the ground, dead. His hands were tied. There was an indication that he was strangled to death by the hoodlums, because there were no gunshot wounds or marks on his body. “After killing him, the hoodlums broke into the shops with a big hammer and other objects and stole some items, after which they left.” Similarly, the death of Karigidi occurred in Ode Irele, the headquarters of the Irele Local Government Area of the state on Monday. Karigidi, who was described as a retired principal and Lay President of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Igbobini Diocese, was reportedly killed by hoodlums in his home early in the morning. It was gathered that the killers invaded the deceased’s home around 3am and carried out the dastardly act. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr Femi Joseph, confirmed the two incidents and said the command had commenced investigation into the killings. “We have begun investigation into the matter and we will soon arrest those behind the ungodly acts,” Joseph stated. He added that the remains of the deceased had been deposited in the morgue. Copyright PUNCH.
