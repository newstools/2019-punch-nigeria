Sodiq Oyeleke Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, has blamed corruption in Nigeria for the call for revolution in the country. Soyinka said this in his speech at the UN World Anti-Corruption Day, held in Abuja on Monday. He told operatives of the Department of State Services to learn how to live with agitation for revolution. It will be recalled that the convener of #RevolutionNow, Omoyele Sowore, is facing trial on seven counts of treasonable felony, and fraud, cyber-stalking, among others. Part of Soyinka’s address reads, “Corruption triggers off numerous collateral activities in institutional conduct and governmental inter-face with citizenry, confrontation with its effects is thus plainly transformational. “This means that, for any corruption degraded society, it should be nothing less than revolutionary in approach — call it by that or any other word, it is still a revolutionary undertaking. “Revolution Now? Or Soon? Later or whenever? “An anti-corruption focus is surely integral to any revolutionary agenda, often it constitutes its very trigger — check any society you wish — from Cuba through China to Egypt or Myanmar. “Corruption is hardly ever omitted in the list of indictments that justify that very undertaking called a revolution. “Thus, anti-corruption activism is a conscious, revolutionary offensive that aims at transformation of the totality of the social phenomena. “Those agencies, or governments that permit themselves to be terrified by the word, had better learn to live with it. “Now we turn our spotlight more specifically on that agency that appears to consider the word treasonable. “In short, let us embrace the liberating, transformative spirit of — if not exactly Revolution Now — then at least, maybe — Liberation Now?”
