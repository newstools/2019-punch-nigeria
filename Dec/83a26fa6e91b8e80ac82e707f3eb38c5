Enyioha Opara, Minna The Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, has   said the  Federal Government is on the verge of connecting Minna with Abuja by rail. Bello dropped the hint when he addressed the last session of the state executive council meeting in Minna recently. The state Commissioner  for Investment, Dr Mustapha Jibril, who confirmed the development,  said  the state government would also  construct  light rail to link Minna with Suleja. Jibril  said, “As a result of the huge cost of carrying out the feasibility study for the project which he put sum N1.2bn,  one of the three firms that showed interest in the job has agreed to do the study without any cost to the state government.” He said the light rail when completed would convey agricultural products from Minna to Suleja from where the goods would be transported to other parts of the country.
