Chukwudi Akasike A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State, Senator Magnus Abe, has said politics of bitterness and division is adversely affecting the development of the state. Abe, however, hailed the state governor, Nyesom Wike, for taking measures to resolve the challenges facing the state. Speaking on Saturday at the funeral of the late Mrs Fyna Atuzie-Boms, wife of a former Attorney General of Rivers State, Worgu, the APC chieftain lamented that bitterness and hatred had characterised Rivers politics. “The greatest challenge that Rivers State faces today is not all the things we have mentioned. It is the fact that hatred and bitterness have characterised our politics and have divided us in a way that we have never been divided before. “It has made it impossible for us to come together to face the challenges that are confronting our state. I want to thank the Governor of Rivers State for leading by example,” Abe said. He praised the governor that while some people were looking for the causes of Rivers’ political challenges, Wike was seeking solutions. “I want to say here today that some people are busy looking for who is causing the problem. But you (Wike) are trying to look for solutions.” In his remarks, Wike described the deceased as a good woman and advised the former state Attorney General to draw strength from his two children.
