Ihuoma Chiedozie The Federal Government has set up a committee on Commercialisation of Research and Development Results, Inventions and Innovations. The committee is to accelerate the commercialisation of research and development results by transforming them into products and services for the benefit of the country. Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, who inaugurated the committee in Abuja on Friday, said Nigeria needs a new generation of businessmen and entrepreneurs who will utilise indigenous technology and innovation to drive economic development. According to the minister, Nigeria’s economy should be primarily driven by indigenous business men and women, to guarantee the country’s security and development. Onu reiterated the determination of the Federal Government to take 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years. “Raising people out of poverty is a challenge that must be tackled to ensure a turnaround in the nation’s economy,” he said. He added that the Federal Government’s Economic and Recovery Growth Plan places science, technology and innovation at the centre of all economic activities in the country. The chairman of the committee, Dr Ekanem Udoh, promised that the committee would live up to its responsibilities. CopyrightPUNCH.
