Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti A House of Representatives member, Wumi Ogunlola, said on Sunday that there was nothing wrong with the idea of a women party in Nigeria in view of the dwindling level of female representation in leadership positions in the country. Ogunlola, who said women were not being given the percentage of representation they deserved in elective and appointive positions, said a women party could come in handy to address such anomaly. The All Progressives Congressâ€™ lawmaker representing Ekiti Central Constituency II, who spoke to journalists at her Ijero Ekiti hometown, in Ekiti State, called for the re-orientation of women across the country.
