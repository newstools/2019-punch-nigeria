Kalu, who is the Senate Chief Whip, also begged the prison warders not to handcuff him in public. The PUNCH reports that, as Kalu and his co-defendants were being removed from the dock by prison officials, they attempted to handcuff him.

I will follow you.” Two unidentified women were also seen weeping as Kalu was being led away. Kalu’s associate, Udeogu, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, while the company which was used in perpetrating the fraud, Slok Limited, was ordered to be wound up by Justice Idris Mohammed.
