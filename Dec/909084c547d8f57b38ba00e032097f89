The Ilorin Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested three persons, including a school vice-principal, for allegedly collecting money from students for examination malpractice. This is contained in a statement signed by Head of Media and Publicity of the commission, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, and made available to the News Agency of NigeriaÂ in Ilorin on Tuesday. The statement said the three persons were arrested at Government Day Secondary School, Otte, Kwara State, during the ongoing National Examination Council-administered examinations. It disclosed that EFCC received an intelligence report that the school management and supervisors of the centre were extorting money from students writing the examination in order to assist them. The statement said the secret was revealed when an operative of the commission in mufti on December 6 pretended to be a passerby and came to the school. It said an iPad containing answers to all the questions was recovered from the culprits, adding that the suspects would soon be charged to court. (NAN)
