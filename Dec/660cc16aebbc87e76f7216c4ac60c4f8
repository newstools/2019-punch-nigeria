Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri Gunmen on Wednesday shot dead a bank customer after dispossessing him of the N200,000 he withdrew from a new generational bank at the Maris junction in Owerri, the Imo State capital. Eyewitnesses told our correspondent that the gunmen, who operated in a Toyota Corolla car, crossed the bank customer, who was identified as Italo, and shot him dead after dispossessing him of the money. One of the eyewitnesses said, “The armed robbers crossed the young man, who just withdrew N200,000 from the bank. They asked him, ‘Where is the money?’ and shot him dead immediately he handed the money over to them. “They went after another man, who ran into a nearby plaza. When they realised that the plaza was locked, they went back and shot repeatedly into the air before zooming off.” Our correspondent gathered that policemen arrived moments later and evacuated the corpse. It was gathered that the deceased hailed from the Anara community in the Isiala Mbano Local Government Area of the state. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Orlando Ikeokwu, did not respond to several calls put across to him by our correspondent. Copyright PUNCH.
