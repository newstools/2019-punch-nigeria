Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt Industrialists at a forum organised by the Association of Charters Certified Accountants have called on the Federal Government to be more committed to providing adequate power supply to Nigerians. The industrialists and other participants met in Port Harcourt on Thursday and insisted that Nigeria would not be able to achieve its developmental goals if the poor state of the power sector remained the same. One of them, Mr Charles Beke, who is the immediate past chairman of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Rivers and Bayelsa zone, explained that entrepreneurs in the country were being frustrated by the poor power supply experienced across the country. He explained that the situation had made industrialists under the umbrella of MAN to consider forming a cluster and invest in power generation to serve only the manufacturing sector. He said, “The challenge of power supply in the country has seriously affected the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria to a point that MAN has decided to open its own power company through the PPP, where its members will be grouped in a cluster and then generate power for themselves.” According to Beke, without power, there is nothing the nation can do. Also, an entrepreneur and owner of Sundry Foods based in Port Harcourt, Mr Ebele Gininwa, said government must address the challenge of poor power supply for the economy to grow. “Simply put, the inability to have a functional and efficient power system in Nigeria is stifling the growth of the economy,” he said.
