The Social Change Network Africa and Women in Leadership Advancement Network have jointly unveiled a joint initiative, ‘ElectHER’ to promote and support more female representation in politics. The co-founder of ElectHER, Ibijoke Faborode, in a statement, stated that the initiative aimed was at improving the significantly low representation of women in Nigerian politics by engaging, encouraging, equipping and enabling women to decide, run and win elections. Faborode expressed disappointment over the statistics of women in the nation’s political landscape and those living with disabilities. She said, “With women constituting half of Nigeria’s population, it is underwhelming to see that there are only eight female senators out of 109 and only 11 female members of the House of Representatives out of 360, which has earned us the poorest record of representation in Africa with only 4.1 per cent of our leaders and policymakers being female. The founder of WILAN, Abosede George-Ogan said women were faced with an uphill battle when venturing into the political space. This, she noted, was because of lack of a formidable support network, inadequate financing, religious and cultural stereotypes and violence.
