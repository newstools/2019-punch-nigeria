He stressed that in accordance with the provisions of the NITDA Act, the FIRS was mandated to assess, collect and pay all accruable levies into the fund, while the board of NITDA had powers to manage the fund. Meanwhile, the House on Friday adjourned plenary till January 28, 2020, to allow members to celebrate the Christmas and the New Year festivities. Copyright PUNCH.
