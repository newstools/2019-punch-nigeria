Enyioha Opara, Minna The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency has arrested 55-year-old Umaru Shehu with 106 sacks of dried weed suspected to be Indian hemp on the Mokwa Road in the Mokwa Local Government Area of Niger State. His arrest was made possible by a tip given to operatives of the anti-drug law enforcement agency by an informant. It was gathered that the suspect is an ex-convict, who had done a jail term for a drug-related offence in the past. In an interview with our correspondent, Shehu, who hails from the Mariga Local Government Area of the state, confessed that he had spent one year in jail after he was convicted for carrying 64kg of dried Indian hemp. He said, “This business is in my blood. It will be difficult for me to stop it now. When I was embarking on this trip from Lagos to Sokoto, I never knew that I will be arrested in Mokwa; it is my luck. “I have made up my mind to stop this business and start livestock business after this trip, but it is unfortunate that I have found myself in the police net.” The state Commander, NDLEA, Sylvia Egwunwoke, told Northern City News in Minna on Sunday that the suspect was arrested on Saturday with 1,072kg of the substance. Egwunwoke said that the matter would be charged to court after investigation. She appealed to members of the public to assist the agency with actionable intelligence to stop the sale and distribution of illicit drugs in the state. Copyright PUNCH.
