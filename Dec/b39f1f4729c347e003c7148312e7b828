He said, “It was with rude shock that we learnt of the passing on of one of our great royal fathers, HRM Eze Sir I.O. Kanu, the Egwu Ukwu II of Afaraukwu Ibeku, at the age of 86 years. “His unwavering love and sterling contributions to the development of his community in particular, and Abia State in general are well documented.

Indeed, Papa has only gone to that better place. “This should be our consolation so that his beloved family and the community he left behind do not continue to weep since we all know that he is resting peacefully now. “As a government, we assure the family of late Eze Sir I.O. Kanu and Afaraukwu community of our continued support in all ways we can to help ameliorate the pains of his departure.”
