Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has released the timetable for the rescheduled Rivers State congresses. A statement by the APC National Organising Secretary, Emma Ibediro, said it rescheduled the congresses following the lifting of the restraining order. The statement said, â€œIn line with the lifting of the restraining order on the Rivers State Congresses, the APC hereby notifies our party members and the general public that our party has rescheduled, to hold congresses in the state. The specific dates and business of the congresses are as follows: According to the notice of the congress, ward congresses will hold on December 21 while appeals arising from them would be heard on December 22. December 23 would be for Local Government Area congresses with the appeals arising fixed for December 24. The state congresses was fixed for December 27 with the appeals slated for December 28. Recall that a Rivers State High Court had in September ordered the party to refrain from conducting its ward, local and state congresses, pending the hearing and determination of a suit marked PHC/3098/19 filed by Ibrahim Umah and 22 others. The interim injunction also ordered the state chapter of the APC (defendant in the suit) and the claimants (Ibrahim Umah and 22 others) to maintain the status quo pending the determination of the matter before the court.
