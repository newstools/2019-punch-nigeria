The Peoples Democratic Party has expressed its dissatisfaction as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress was declared winner of Saturday bye-election in Katsina State. The Independent National Electoral Commission had declared Ibrahim Danjuma winner of the Sabuwa State Constituency bye-election, having polled 11,745 votes, against Ibrahim Shafiu of PDP who got 6,160 votes. Other candidates who participated in the election were Sagir Isa Bako of MPN (11 votes), Idris Sabiu of NLDP (7 votes) and Dahiru Ahmed of PDC (15 votes). According to the Returning Officer, Dr. Usman Adamu Bello of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State, total accredited voters were 18,572, while total votes cast stood at 18,276. Valid votes were 17,938, while 338 were voided, he said. In reaction, Katsina State Chairman of PDP, Salisu Majigiri, told newsmen at the INEC LG headquarter in Sabuwa that “the election was marred by irregularities, vote buying and substantial non compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act.” He said his party would challenge the results at the election petitions tribunal. “We will go to court, because this election will not stand legal scrutiny. “There were several cases of irregularities, including vote buying, and falsification of results,” Majigiri said. The bye election was held to choose a replacement for Mustapha Abdullahi, who died in a motor accident in July.
