Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi The Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria has released a preliminary report on an incident involving a Boeing 737-500 aircraft owned and operated by Med-View Airline. The AIB on Sunday said that from initial findings, the flight, which had 27 passengers and six crew members on board, experienced loss of pressurisation on descent into the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, and requested for priority landing without initially disclosing the nature of the emergency. The Med-View aircraft with nationality and registration marks 5N-BQM was en route to the MMIA, Lagos, from Abuja on July 23, 2019, when the incident occurred at 2,000 feet above mean sea level, according to the report. The bureau, however, stated that the airline failed to report the incident as required by regulation 13(1) of the Civil Aviation (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 2019, adding that it became aware of the incident from the news media. “The preliminary reports are not the final reports as they contain details of the initial facts, discussions and findings surrounding the occurrences; which include information gathered from witness statements, flight recorders, Health and Usage Monitoring System Data, Flight Data Monitoring data, and preliminary inspection of the accident sites and the wreckage,” the bureau said. The AIB said investigations were still ongoing on the incident and final report would be released at the end of the investigations. CopyrightPUNCH.
