DANIELS IGONI Gunmen who abducted the six-year-old son of the Bayelsa State Commissioner for Water Resources, Mr Nengi Talbot, have demanded N50m ransom to release the little boy. Talbot disclosed this in an exclusive chat with our correspondent on Saturday. The victim, Antonio, spent Christmas Day in the custody of the assailants following his kidnap on Monday, December 23. The hoodlums had invaded the commissioner’s residence at the New Commissioners’ Quarter in Opolo area of Yenagoa and took their target away at gunpoint. Talbot said the bandits made the N50m ransom demand on Friday when they called him on his mobile phone for the second time since the incident happened. He said he did not have such an amount of money to secure the freedom of his little son. The commissioner said he had not seen such a huge sum of money in his entire life and pleaded with the kidnappers to release Antonio unconditionally on humanitarian grounds. Talbot said, “They have not released my son. They contacted me yesterday (Friday) and asked for N50m. Where do I get that kind of money? I have not even seen that kind of money in my life.” Copyright PUNCH.
