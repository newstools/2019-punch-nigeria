A shooting killed two people and wounded at least seven while they were filming a music video in the US state of Texas, authorities said Saturday. “We are now at 9 total gunshot wound victims: 2 were confirmed deceased at the scene, 1 was critical, the others remain hospitalized,” Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez tweeted. The attack on a group of Hispanic men in their 20s occurred around 9:30 pm Friday (0330 GMT Saturday) at a parking lot in a residential Houston neighbourhood, Gonzalez said at a media briefing that night.

Police do not yet know the motive for the shooting, he added. According to government figures, around 40,000 people died from gunfire in 2017 in the US, a country that is plagued by frequent gun violence. (AFP)
