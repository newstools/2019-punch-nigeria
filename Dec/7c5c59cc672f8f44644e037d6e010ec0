Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt THE Rivers State Government is to launch a security trust fund in January 2020 as part of its move to strengthen security in the state to attract more investments. The State Governor, Nyesom Wike, explained that all major companies operating in the state must contribute to the state security fund because they benefit from the resources and infrastructure of Rivers. Wike said this during a courtesy visit by the President of Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, Hajiya Iya Aliyu, on Monday at the Government House in Port Harcourt. He said, “By January 2020, we will hold a security summit and also launch a security trust fund. “All the major companies operating in the state are under obligation to contribute. “We are committed to improving security in order to attract more investments in the state. We are developing the right infrastructure for economic development.” Wike pointed out that the state would write Dangote Plc to contribute as it does in other states, adding that the company uses the state’s infrastructure for her businesses. He said, “Dangote has not contributed anything to this state. I will write him to support the security trust fund. “I cannot do roads and your trailers will take over our roads. If you go to G.U. Ake Road, you will see Dangote trailers all over the state. “Zenith Bank, Access Bank and other major companies must contribute to Rivers State Security Trust Fund as they contribute to Lagos State.
