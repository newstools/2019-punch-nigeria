Abiodun Nejo, Ado-Ekiti The crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party in Ekiti State got messier on Friday when the party’s legal officer, Sunday Olowolafe, tackled the state chairman, Chief Gboyega Oguntuwase, over the sale of the new secretariat of the party in Ado Ekiti, the state capital. Olowolafe said the chairman’s allegation that neither he nor the PDP State Working Committee signed the document with which former Governor Ayodele Fayose sold the party secretariat was “inglorious lie, perfidious statement and unacceptable”. The PDP state chairman had told journalists in Ado Ekiti on Thursday that “To the best of my knowledge as chairman of the party, and the knowledge of many SWC members, we have not sold the secretariat. The PDP will reclaim the secretariat through legal means if it had been fraudulently sold. “Fayose said or alleged that the secretariat of the party had been sold with the knowledge of the party chairman and members of the SWC. With due respect to his person, we consider the statement as misleading, malicious, and condemnable. But Olowolafe said, “The chairman signed the letter of ‘acceptance of refund’ dated January 18, 2017. If he (Oguntuwase) wants to deny his signature, he should proceed to the court rather than his comical entertainment of the public at the expense of the party’s image. Copyright PUNCH.
