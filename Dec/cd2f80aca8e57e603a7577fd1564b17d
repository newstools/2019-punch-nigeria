Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The former governorship candidate of the Action Alliance in Imo State, Uche Nwosu, has said that he no longer harboured grudges against those who truncated his ambition of emerging the governor of the state. Nwosu, who spoke to journalists at Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri, on Saturday, said he had put behind him the recent Supreme Court’s judgment which disqualified him from the state’s governorship race on the premise of dual nominations by the AA and the All Progressives Congress. He said he would support whoever gets judgment in his favour in the legal tussle on the state governorship election before the apex court. He said his major interest was for the people of the state to have access to quality leadership and dividends of democracy. Nwosu said members of the APC in the state should come together and rebuild the party after losing the state to the Peoples Democratic Party. He said, “I have kept all that happened over my governorship pursuit behind me and I have decided to move on with life since God is alive. “I have forgiven all those who ganged up against me in my earnest desire to serve lmo people as their governor. I have no regret in politics, especially as it concerns my contest for the governorship of the state. “I will support any of the candidates the final judgment of the Supreme Court on the lmo governorship will favour, whether it is Senator lfeanyi Araraume, Senator Hope Uzodinma or Chief Emeka lhedioha, since politics is not a do or die affair, but a matter of give and take. “What the APC in the state needs now is for all stakeholders to come together for the sake of the party.” Copyright PUNCH.
