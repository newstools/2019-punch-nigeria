Ted Odogwu, Kano The Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, on Thursday, signed the 2019 Emirate Council Bill into law. The ceremony, which took place at the Coronation Hall of the Government House, Kano marked the creation of five emirates in the state. Earlier on Thursday, the Kano State House of Assembly had during a plenary session, which lasted about 10 minutes, passed the bill into law. The new law creates additional four emirates council in the state. They are Bichi, Gaya, Rano and Karaye. Before the passage by the House, a Kano State High Court, presided over by Justice Usman Nabba, had restrained the governor, the House of Assembly, their servants, agents and proxies from passing the bill or enacting the law. In its judgment, the court held that the proceedings or discussions taken by the Kano State House of Assembly in respect of the law violated its own rule, adding that the legislators failed to comply with Order II, Rule 3 of the Kano State House of Assembly. While signing the bill into law, the governor said, “After successfully passing the bill by the House, here we are, witnessing the signing of the bill into a law; and our emirates have come to stay.” READ ALSO: Strike looms in Ogun over minimum wage All things concerning the new Emirates were done, according to the governor, “to bring development closer to the people. We need sustainable socio-economic development for our dear state. We need further improvement in the security system and the well-being of our people.” Ganduje warned, “Any emir or any traditional ruler, who goes against the provisions of this law, such a person will definitely face the music. He will surely be punished without waste of time.” Copyright PUNCH.
