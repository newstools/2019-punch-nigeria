Wale Oyewale The Oyo State Government said on Sunday that it would prosecute 25 persons caught driving under the influence of alcohol. This followed the resolution by the state government to conduct breath test on drivers that violate traffic regulations, especially during the ember months. The Executive Chairman of the Oyo State Road Transport Management Authority, Dr Akin Fagbemi, said the arrests of the drunk drivers was in tandem with the mandate of the agency to curb road crashes occasioned by reckless and drunk drivers. “Between 8pm and 11pm on Friday, December 27, we impounded about five trailers and three cars whose drivers were either caught drinking alcohol while driving or while already drunk along the Ring Road, Iwo Road, Moniya and Ogbomoso axis. “This was made possible with the aid of our modern stop-and-test alcohol detection device provided by the state government. Let it be known that for several months, we have carried out an extensive campaign against drunk-driving in Oyo State, in visual, social, print and non-print media, before the beginning of the ember months and this festive period. He disclosed that the 25 persons alleged of drunk-driving would be charged and arraigned before the mobile magistrate court on Monday (today) and anyone found guilty would be dealt with according to the law of the state.
