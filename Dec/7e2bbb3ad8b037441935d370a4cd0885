Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan,  has assured Nigerians that the upper chamber will begin work on the Petroleum Industry Bill as soon as the senators resume in January next year. He also said the red chamber would begin consideration of the various amendments being proposed in form of bills by some senators. Lawan, according to a statement on Sunday by his media aide, Ola Awoniyi, stated this at the end-of-year get-together/award ceremony organised by the Senate management for its staff. He said, “By the time the lawmakers return from their break in January, the Petroleum Industry Bill which appeared to have defied passage and the constitutional amendment which is a continuous exercise will be addressed. “The mode of operation of this current Senate is: we don’t give space; we don’t create any space in the middle. We just want it done and done away with it.” He said the 9th Senate was in a hurry to deliver on some of the targets set in its legislative agenda ahead of the 2023 elections. Copyright PUNCH.
