Phanfone battered eastern and central provinces on Christmas Day, forcing over 58,000 residents to stay in evacuation centres as gale-force winds tore off rooftops and destroyed less sturdy houses. The weather bureau said the typhoon was packing maximum sustained winds of 120km per hour (kph) and gusts of up to 150 kph as it moved north-west away from the country. It added that the Typhoon was no longer affecting the country, but the tail-end of a cold front would bring heavy rain over the northern Philippines. Phanfone was the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines in 2019. One of the strongest typhoons ever recorded, Typhoon Haiyan, hit the country in November 2013, killing more than 6,300 people and displacing more than 4 million. (dpa/NAN)
