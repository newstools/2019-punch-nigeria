’Femi Asu Axxela Limited, a gas and power portfolio company, has highlighted the importance of maximising the gas resources in Nigeria and other West African countries to boost industrialisation. The firm reiterated its commitment to the region’s industrialisation at Ghana Gas Forum in Accra, Ghana, saying it would continue to build natural gas infrastructure, according to a statement. Axxela Head of Sales and Marketing, Tunde Baba-Agba, said: “Natural gas is now highly regarded as a key resource of the energy sector, and a key component geared towards value creation for West Africa’s economies. “We’re confident that our strategic initiatives and the expansion of our operational footprint particularly within the virtual pipeline, gas processing and distribution, and embedded power spaces will help unlock the vast potential within important economic clusters across the region.” According to the statement, Axxela is a designated natural gas shipper on the West African Gas Pipeline and a private sector-led developer of natural gas distribution in Nigeria. “With over 280km in gas pipeline infrastructure built, Axxela provides unique energy solutions primarily through its main subsidiaries: Gaslink Nigeria Limited, Gas Network Services Limited, and Central Horizon Gas Company Limited,” it said. The Head, Executive Committee, The Gas Consortium, organisers of the event, Senam Gbeho, said by implementing the right policies and decision-making structures, the region’s gas resources could be the catalyst that would eliminate its distressing poverty levels.
