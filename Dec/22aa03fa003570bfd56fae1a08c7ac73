Nike Popoola The President, Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, Jenny Gu, has said that Africa can emerge as the world’s next economic superpower. She said this at ACCA’s three-day Africa Members Conference, which attracted 840 delegates from 33 African nations, in Kigali, Rwanda. In a statement, she said, “People often ask for my views on future economic trends, and on what might happen in business in the coming years. I imagine they expect me to say that the future belongs to the East; or if not to Asia, then to a resurgent USA; or to an emboldened Europe. “But I don’t. I say that the most promising is Africa; this continent with an increasingly young population; a continent of limitless natural resources and a continent bursting with energy, innovation and potential.” Gu also emphasised the need for sustainable economic development. She said, “As we all know, of all the continents in the world, Africa has the most to lose from the threat of climate change. This is happening now. Millions are displaced from their homes by extreme weather events and drought, as rising temperatures make once-fertile lands uninhabitable. Copyright PUNCH.
