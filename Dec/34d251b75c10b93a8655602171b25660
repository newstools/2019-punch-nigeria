On Monday, analysts at Afrinvest Securities Limited said sell-offs in MTN Nigeria Communications Plc, FBN Holdings Plc and Ecobank Transnational Incorporated dragged the All-Share Index 1.6 per cent lower to close at 26,115.80 basis points as the year-to-date loss settled at 16.9 per cent.

In terms of sectoral performance, the AFR-ICT lost the most, paring 3.7 per cent on the back of sell-off in MTN while price depreciation in Ecobank and Guaranty Trust Bank Plc dragged the banking index down by 0.8 per cent. The industrial and consumer goods indices also declined by 0.31 per cent and 0.18 per cent, respectively, owing to price decline in Cement Company of Northern Nigeria Plc and Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc. Conversely, the oil and gas and insurance indices gained 0.62 per cent and 0.45 per cent, respectively, due to buying interest in Oando Plc, Linkage Assurance Plc and Aiiico Insurance Plc.

A total of 17 gainers were recorded, led by Japaul Oil and Maritime Services Plc, while Cornerstone Insurance Plc led 14 losers. “We expect bearish performance to persist in the near term as investors maintain a risk-off attitude towards the equities market. However, this is a good time to cherry-pick fundamentally sound stocks,” analysts at Afrinvest said. CopyrightPUNCH.
