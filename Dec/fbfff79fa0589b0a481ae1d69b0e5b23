Wale Oyewale Five persons were feared dead and others injured in an auto crash that involved two vehicles along the Ilorin-Ogbomoso Road on Thursday. An eyewitness, Mr Ade Akanmu, said four people, two men and women, died on the spot while the last person died before getting to the hospital. Akanmu said, “It was a gory sight. Two vehicles were involved; one is a Mitsubishi Lancer, marked OYO GBY 322AA, and the other car with registration number OYO RUW 135 XA. “The accident, which occurred at Ladokun in the Surulere North LCDA of Oyo State, happened when an Ilorin-bound passenger vehicle collided with another vehicle on the opposite side of the road. “In all, four people, two men and two women, died on the spot. Others suffered varying degrees of injuries. We rescued the victims by cutting parts of the vehicles with an axe.” One of the passengers who lost their lives in the accident was identified as Chief Alaaga by some sympathisers at the scene. It was gathered that the late Alaaga was coming from a meeting when he met his death. When contacted on the telephone, the state Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps, Mrs Uche Chukura, said two females and two males died in the accident. However, an FRSC official in Ogbomoso Zone, who confirmed the incident, said some men had been dispatched to the scene of the crash. Copyright PUNCH.
