John Ameh, Abuja The Federal Government will gradually withdraw military operations in some volatile spots in the country, beginning from the first quarter of 2020. The withdrawal of troops will be done after an “assessment” to determine areas where peace has returned to enable civil authorities to assume full control of security. The decision was reached during a Security Council meeting, which ended at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, around 1.50 pm. The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), presided over the session. The Council decided that in place of the military, the Nigeria Police Force, which has the primary responsibility of providing internal security, will assume its duties fully in such areas.

Ekwe Ibas declined to name the specific states of geopolitical zones where the military would withdraw its operations. Recall that the military runs several joint internal operations in various parts of the country with different code names to combat one security threat or another.
