Wale Oyewale, Ibadan An Oyo State High Court sitting in Iyaganku, Ibadan, has sentenced one Hammed Mutiu to nine months’ imprisonment without an option of fine for visa racketeering. Mutiu had faced 16 counts bordering on obtaining money under false pretences, altering and forging documents filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibadan zonal office. His arraignment was sequel to a petition jointly signed by four of his victims in which he was alleged to have collected a total of N4,350,000 on the pretext that could procure Canadian visas for them. According to the charges, Mutiu claimed to be what he was not in order to take advantage of the victims, who were desperate to seek greener pastures outside of the country.
