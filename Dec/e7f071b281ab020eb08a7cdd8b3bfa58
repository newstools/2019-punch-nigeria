Hindi Livinus, Yola Adamawa chapter of the All Progressives Congress has rejected the outcome of the local government council elections conducted in the state. The party’s state legal adviser, Shagnah Pwamadi, described the election as “a selection backed by law enforcement agents,” saying it was the reason the APC rejected the result of the polls. He said, “The APC is rejecting the outcomes of the election because it was not conducted in compliance with the provision of the Adamawa State electoral law. “Therefore, it is undemocratic and a clear display of an act of selection backed by law enforcement agencies.” Results for one council were still being awaited out of the 21 local government areas when the APC decided it would not accept the outcome of the polls. Unofficial results indicated the ruling Peoples Democratic Party had swept all 20 chairmanship seats from results collated so far by ADSIEC. The APC also lamented that the elections “fell far below standards because 95 per cent of ad hoc electoral officials recruited by ADSIEC for the exercise” were allegedly PDP card-carrying members.
