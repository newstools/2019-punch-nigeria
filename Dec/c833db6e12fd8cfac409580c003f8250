Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has revealed plans by his administration to upgrade Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education to a University of Education. The Governor said this on Monday when he received the newly elected Zonal Coordinators of the National Association of Nigerian Students, Zone D, led by Kappo Olawale at the Lagos House, Alausa. Sanwo-Olu, in a close chat with the group assured them of the continuous commitment of his administration to the reforms of education sector, stating that the sector has the “lion’s share” in the year 2020 budget. He said, “We want to elevate Adesanya Ogunsanya College of Education to a University of Education. This is one of our plans as a government. “We are training all Primary School teachers and also recruiting new ones. We will ensure that the quality in our classrooms are the same. And this is based on development of teachers first. Once we are able to push that, we will also improve the quality of teaching. We will see better outcome and that will give us better pupils. “We will also duplicate this in Secondary Schools across Lagos. We want to continue to reduce truancy, cultism and all those unhealthy acts amongst pupils. We will increase infrastructure in Schools.” He urged the students’ leaders to ensure that they uphold peace in their various institutions and be good representatives of their citadels of learning.
