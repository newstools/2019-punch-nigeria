A former beauty queen, Amaani Noor, who once dated Nigerian-born Liverpool footballer Sheyi Ojo, has been convicted of funding terrorism. Ms. Noor was handed an 18-month jail term on Friday (today) after she was found guilty of sending money overseas to a jihadist fighter who she had met online and later married. Her ex-boyfriend, Oluwaseyi Babajide ‘Sheyi’ Ojo is Nigerian-born English footballer who plays for Scottish Premiership side Rangers, and currently on loan from Liverpool, as a winger. Ojo joined Liverpool as a 14-year-old and came through their academy. Now 22 years old, Ojo had started dating Noor as a 17-year-old football rising star, and they both had a long-term relationship, according to UK Mirror online. The jury was told Noor had been in a relationship with a professional footballer when she was a teenager and also had a short marriage to a preacher. The player was not named, but Noor had dated Nigerian-born Sheyi Ojo, who is currently on loan at Rangers. Noor, 21, was wooed online by a man she fondly addressed as “Hakim My Love;” and had told him, “It’s been my dream to marry a fighter for a long time and my dream to be a fighter myself even longer.” Noor, of Cinema Drive in Wavertree, Liverpool, had claimed she believed that the $45 she donated to the Merciful Hands organisation on May 23, 2018, would go to buy food for women and children in Syria. But earlier this month, a jury found her guilty of fundraising for terrorists contrary to the Terrorism Act 2000. She was in tears as she was told she would be jailed.
