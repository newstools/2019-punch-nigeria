A community of fintech entrepreneurs, regulators and companies known as Financial Services Innovators has unveiled an industry innovation sandbox in conjunction with the Central Bank of Nigeria, Flourish, EFInA and the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System. The group said the industry innovation sandbox was designed to connect innovators to regulators in order to responsibly bring new financial services solutions to the market. Speaking on the sidelines of EFInA’s Financial Inclusion Conference where it was unveiled in Lagos on Thursday, the first Executive Director, FSI, Mr Aituazobe Kola-Oladejo, said the initiative was aimed at building an inclusive ecosystem of fintech innovators while lowering the barriers to financial innovation. Kola-Oladejo, a former head of research and development at the NIBSS, added that the new industry innovation sandbox would enable registered members to leverage the platform to build a solution within the sandbox environment before seeking regulatory approval from the CBN or partnering an existing financial services provider licensed by the CBN. He said, “This is a community of fintech enthusiasts passionate about driving innovation in the financial services industry. The effort, which is supported by over N250m in multi-year grants from Flourish and EFInA is intended to lower the barriers to innovation within the financial services ecosystem.” A principal at Flourish, one of the collaborators, Ameya Upadhyay, said through the industry sandbox, the FSI would help accelerate the growth of Nigeria’s fintech ecosystem and bring about innovative services that would help improve Nigerians’ financial health.
