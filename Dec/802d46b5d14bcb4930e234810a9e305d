Peter Dada, Akure No fewer than three persons have reportedly lost their lives in a road accident, which occurred in Erusu Akoko, in the Akoko North West Local Government Area of Ondo State. It was gathered that the victims, simply identified as Mubarak, Abu and Pastor, were on a motorcycle when they were knocked down by a bus, on their way to Gedegede community. The Ikare Akoko Unit Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Mr Yinka Akande, on Tuesday confirmed the incident, saying the accident was caused as a result of recklessness on the part of the driver of the bus, who fled the scene of the accident. He said, “It was a case of reckless driving. That is why we have been campaigning against reckless driving and night journey.” READ ALSO: Buhari names Adamu as new AMCON chairman A source in the community said the driver of the bus fled the scene while the remains of the deceased were deposited at the mortuary of the Ondo State Specialists Hospital, Ikare Akoko.

The monarch appealed to government to, as a matter of urgency build speed bumps on the road particularly in the township, to forestall incessant crashes.
