A member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Mufutau Egberongbe, has commended the ability of Nigerians to persevere in the face of whatever challenges facing the nation. In his Christmas message to Nigerians, Egberongbe, representing Apapa Federal Constituency, said Nigeria was very fortunate to be peopled by a resilient population. According to the lawmaker, the level of perseverance is keeping Nigeria united in spite of security threats and other challenges facing the nation over the years. Egberongbe said: “Nigeria is not great because of its size, but because the about 200 million citizens have decided in their thoughts and actions to strengthen the country. He commended Nigerians for their patience with the government, assuring them that the regime of the President, Major General Muhammad Buhari (retd.) would leave a lasting legacy, “the foundation of which was already being laid.” He urged Nigerians, especially Christians, to continue to pray for the country, themselves and the government, saying that the virtues of Jesus Christ cannot be over-emphasised at this period. “Jesus preached the act of giving. We should learn to reach out to the poor and put smiles on the faces of the needy and less privileged at all times too,” the lawmaker said. (NAN)
