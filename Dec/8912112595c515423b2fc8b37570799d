A former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has stated the condition under which he will support the controversial ‘Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill’ pending before the National Assembly. The Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill is being sponsored by Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, who was elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress. The very extensive bill covers a handful of possible wrongdoings, including the publication or presentation of materials deemed to stir up ethnic hatred. The Bill also takes aim at written or visual acts seen as threatening, abusive, insulting or offensive. It recommends that any person who commits an offence of the kind described could be jailed for life; and if the actions are found to have caused loss of life, the punishment can be death by hanging. Taking to his verified Twitter handle @realFFK on Monday afternoon, Fani-Kayode said he would support the Hate Speech Bill if its provisions are made retroactive and if its first victims are President Muhammadu Buhari, APC National Leader Bola Tinubu, Information Minister Lai Mohammed, and others he also mentioned. He wanted a promise that the public figures he mentioned would be the first set of people to be hanged “for their hateful words over the years,” after which he would support the bill. Suffice to say, the clause recommending death sentence has, however, been withdrawn by the bill’s sponsor. See the tweet:
