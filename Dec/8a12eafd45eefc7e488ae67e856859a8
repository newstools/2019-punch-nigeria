Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The winner of the supplementary senatorial election for Kogi West, Smart Adeyemi, has begged Nigerians to forgive what he called the misdemeanor of his co-contestant, Dino Melaye, saying that did not represent the true character of Okun people. Adeyemi made the appeal on Sunday while thanking the people for returning him to the Senate. He promised not to disappoint them and the people he would be representing. He said, “I want to plead with Nigerians, especially our leaders such as President Muhamadu Buhari; Bola Tinubu; our governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello; former President Olusegun Obasanjo and everyone whom Dino had insulted one time or the other, to please forgive him. “His behaviour does not represent the culture and value of Okun people. This has been demonstrated by Saturday’s verdict when he was unanimously rejected.” He said he had not been comfortable with the way Melaye allegedly turned himself and the people of the area into objects of ridicule. Adeyemi described the Senate as a place meant for experienced persons who will bring their wealth of experience to bear in providing leadership for the people. He promised to provide quality leadership and representation which he said the people had lacked in the last four years. Copyright PUNCH.
