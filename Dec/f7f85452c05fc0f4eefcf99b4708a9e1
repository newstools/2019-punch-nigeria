Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa The outgoing administration of the Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, will not present any budget for the 2020 fiscal year to the state House of Assembly for consideration and approval. The Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Daniel Iworiso-Markson, who stated this in a statement on Monday, explained that the 2019 budget would run till the end of Dickson’s tenure on February 14, 2020. He also dismissed claims in some quarters that the government was making effort to obtain new loans. His clarification followed reports that the state government had forwarded a letter to the House of Assembly seeking approval of N1.793bn for the purchase of official vehicles for judges in the state’s judiciary. It was gathered that the request for the fund emanated from the judicial arm of the government in the spirit of the autonomy bill passed by the House. Iworiso-Markson said the government was not shopping for new loans and had not taken any major loans in the past two and half years. According to him, the outgoing government had not also received any loan from any financial institution. He said, “Dickson is reputed to have led a transparent and decent government in almost eight years and would not initiate any step that could impact adversely on any incoming administration.” Copyright PUNCH.
