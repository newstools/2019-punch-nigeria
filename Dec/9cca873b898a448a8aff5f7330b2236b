Hindi Livinus, Yola Officers and men of the Adamawa/Taraba Command of the Nigeria Customs Service on Friday raided Mubi town market for foreign rice and other contraband. The raid, led by the Comptroller, Kamardeen Olumoh, resulted in the seizure of many bags of foreign rice and the arrest of three suspects. The customs personnel, with reinforcement from the police, stormed the commercial border town main market around 11am and raided many shops and stores. Speaking on the development, the Comptroller said the raid was in compliance with a directive from the Comptroller-General of the service in Abuja. He said, “The menace of smuggling around this axis has been alarming for quite some time. The Comptroller-General of Customs ordered that the operations be carried out, that Mubi market must be mopped up of all smuggled items, especially foreign rice. Olumoh said, “Today, we are in the market and we are able to evacuate large quantity of rice and this is a clear signal to smugglers.

Section 147 of Customs and Excise Management Act has given us the power to enter or search premises day or night, to break and enter, make arrest; in fact, without warrant and that is exactly what we did today.” There was, however, mixed reactions over the raid in Mubi. Most traders spoken to after the raid condemned the action of the customs, as they counted their losses. Copyright PUNCH.
