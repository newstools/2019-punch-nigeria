Samson Folarin The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has vowed that harsh punishment awaits anyone who attacks men of the state’s law enforcement agencies in the line of duty. He expressed displeasure with the killing of an official of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, Ganiyu Oyeshina, who was attacked by two trailer drivers in the Sifax-Iganmu area of Apapa. The 34-year-old Osun State indigene died on Saturday from injuries he sustained during the attack. The governor, while describing the attack as “mindless and callous,” said it was a wake-up call to all Lagosians. Sanwo-Olu spoke on Monday during his condolence visit to the family of the deceased in company with members of the State Executive Council. While commiserating with the family, he said government would not sit and watch motorists or anyone wilfully break the laws or inflict injuries on state officials. The governor said, “In the last 48 hours, we have had heavy brutality on men of LASTMA who were doing their work. We have had people whose legs were amputated in the last 48 hours while on the assignment that was given to them to bring about enforcement of our laws and order. “I think this is the level at which we need to make this very stern warning that we will not stop at ensuring that we implement and enforce our laws, not minding which force is involved. “We cannot be condoning reckless killing and sending our young men to early grave. This government certainly will not stand for that.” The governor vowed that Oyeshina’s killers would face the law. Copyright PUNCH.
