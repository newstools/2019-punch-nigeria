Bola Bamigbola Lifeless body of a lecturer, Dr Nicholas Igbokwe, was on Saturday morning found in his office at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. Until his death, Igbokwe was a lecturer in the Physical and Health Education Department of the university. Although there is no official statement yet as to how the incident happened, a source in the department, said the late academic might have died on Friday without anyone knowing about it. The source said, “His lifeless body was already cold when it was discovered around 12 midnight on Saturday. “That suggests he died on Friday without anyone knowing about it. I passed by his office around 7.30pm on Friday and his car was not parked at the usual spot. So, no one knew he was around. “Some members of staff later observed light was on in his office and entered there. He was already cold by then.” The lecturer was confirmed dead at the university’s health centre.
