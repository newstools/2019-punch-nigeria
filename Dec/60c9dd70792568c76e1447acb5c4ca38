The National Body of the Licensed Electrical Contractors Association of Nigeria has called on the Federal Government to patronise locally made cables to save foreign exchange. The body made this call during a tour of Coleman Wires and Cables factory at Sagamu, Ogun State, by the national body of the association from all the 36 states of the federation. The team of electrical contractors led by its National President, Chief  J.J. Etim, and first National Vice President, Mr Akintomide Oluyinka, was conducted round the Coleman Wires & Cables factory by the Managing Director/Chief Executive officer of the company, Mr George Onafowokan, and the Executive Director, Mr Michael Onafowokan. After a tour of the factory, Etim expressed delight at the investment in the factory and the products, describing them as very outstanding and of high quality. He said he used to import his cables and wires from India but with the standard of Coleman products, he and his colleagues would henceforth patronise Coleman’s products. Etim also used the occasion to call on the Federal Government and all its agencies to patronise Coleman’s products in order to save foreign exchange as well as boost the nation’s industrial base described as critical to Nigeria’s economic prosperity Speaking in the same vein, Oluyinka said the factory tour was an eye-opener as it had confirmed that Coleman produced and sold standard electrical items, including wires and cables. He reaffirmed that every member of their association would patronise Coleman since its products were readily available in the country, saying that the days of importing electrical wires and cables from overseas were over.
