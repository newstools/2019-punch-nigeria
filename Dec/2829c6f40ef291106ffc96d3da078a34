Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Police Command, on Wednesday, stated that the two Catholic priests abducted by gunmen in the state had regained their freedom. The development came few days after the clerics were kidnapped. The priests, Rev. Frs. Joseph Nweke and Felix Efobi from the Catholic Diocese of Awka in Anambra State, were kidnapped on the Benin-Owo Expressway at Elegbeka area of the Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State. They were on their way to Akure for a wedding before they were abducted on Friday evening. The kidnappers had demanded N100m ransom for the release of the clergymen. Speaking on the development on Wednesday, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr Femi Joseph, said the priests were freed as a result of the efforts of the men of the command, who combed the forest where the victims were taken to by their abductors. He also stated that no ransom was paid before the victims were released. The PPRO said, “I can confirm that the two priests have been rescued from the den of the hoodlums. Immediately the incident happened, we deployed our men to comb the forest; it was when we closed in on the abductors that they released the victims and ran away. “Even though the victims  have been released, we are still after the bandits and very soon, we will get them.” Copyright PUNCH.
