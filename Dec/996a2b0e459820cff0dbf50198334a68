Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki THE Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, on Monday, urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to convoke a national dialogue of all ethnic, religious and interest groups in Nigeria, to seek their opinions on how to move the country forward. According to the Igbo youth group, with the current perceived collapse of governance in the country, Nigeria is on the threshold of disintegration and extinction. The group said with the likes of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and a former Minister of Defence, Lt.-Gen. Theophilus Danjuma (retd.), rising up recently to raise the alarm over the country’s possible “implosion,” there was an urgent need for the citizenry to be on the alert. The OYC stated this in a statement signed by its President-General, Okechukwu Isigusoro; and Secretary-General, Okwu Nnabuike, a copy of which was made available to The PUNCH. The statement read, “The recent statement credited to Lt.-Gen. TY Danjuma on the state of the nation and that of former President Obasanjo, who recently spoke about imminent war in the country, should make Nigerians to be on their alert. “Even lately, the USA classified Nigeria as one of the counties on its security watch list. This is not good for us as a people. This further shows indices of collapsed governance in the country. “We call on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), as a matter of urgency, to convoke a national dialogue of all ethnic, religious and interest groups. This will tame any future uprising and civil disobedience.” CopyrightPUNCH.
