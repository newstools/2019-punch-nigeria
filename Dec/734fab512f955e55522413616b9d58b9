Ada Wodu, Calabar The police have explained why they could not rescue a young man, who allegedly robbed and raped a girl in Calabar, Cross River State, and was beaten to death by a mob on Christmas Day. Explaining what happened, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo, said the victim “later died because he couldn’t survive the assault on him.” Ugbo stated, “The police rescued him but before we could take him to hospital, he died. We could not make any arrest. In the case of a mob action, it is difficult to investigate. Nobody has come to lay any complaint. “We will try to reduce jungle justice and possibly eradicate it. We will continue to sensitise the people to the danger and the offence of killing another person. It is an offence. It is unfortunate that when such things happen, it is not easy to grab somebody.” READ ALSO: Social media and hate speech bills disturbing – Don It was gathered that the incident happened on Wednesday on the Ekong Etta Street by Okoro Agbor.
