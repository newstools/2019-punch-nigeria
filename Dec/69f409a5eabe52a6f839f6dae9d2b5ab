Etim Ekpimah Actionaid Nigeria has warned against the diversion of constituency projects, stressing that the country cannot develop if those in charge of projects frustrate them. The organisation gave the warning at a symposium on accountability organised by Actionaid on Saturday. The Director, Public Enlightenment, Independent Corrupt Practices Commission, Mrs Rasheedat Okoduwa, said if Nigerians failed to see constituency projects as their own and ask questions, those responsible for such projects, would convert them to personal use. She said, “There is something I need to say here, which bothers on our roles as citizens. When you put pressure on public office holders, telling them you have just got a child and that you need money for naming, to pay school fees, among others, you are asking him to live above their means. “Where do you expect him to get the money from? As he struggles to meet some of these needs, he is likely to steal through the constituency projects. It is your own money they will steal and later give you the crumbs. So, we have roles as citizens not to do that.” Copyright PUNCH.
