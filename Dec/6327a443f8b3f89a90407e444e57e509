He noted that the non-oil sector’s contribution to the Nigerian economy had risen to 60 per cent by November 2019 from 54 per cent in December 2018. Fowler said that the continuous drop in oil prices was a sign that attention should be focused on the non-oil sector of the economy which he said was more sustainable. He said, “We are moving from oil-dependent to non-oil-dependent economy. We believe that in the next three years, the non-oil sector is going to contribute at least 80 per cent of the total revenue.” He noted that the deployment of online solutions was making tax administration more efficient, transparent and convenient.
