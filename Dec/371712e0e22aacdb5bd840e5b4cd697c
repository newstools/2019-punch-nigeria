Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Police Command on Wednesday disclosed that the two Catholic priests abducted by gunmen in the state had regained their freedom. The development came a few days after the clerics were kidnapped. The two priests, Rev. Fr. Joseph Nweke and Rev. Fr. Felix Efobi, from Awka Catholic Diocese in Anambra State were reportedly kidnapped on the Benin-Owo Expressway at the Elegbeka area of Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State, on their way to Akure, the state capital, for a wedding, on Friday evening. The kidnappers had also demanded a sum of N100million for the release of the clergymen. Speaking on the development, the Public Relations Officer of the state police command, Mr Femi Joseph, said the priests were freed as a result of the efforts of the men of the command who had since combed the forest where the victims were taken to by the abductors. He also stated that no ransom was paid before the victims were released. The PPRO said, “I can confirm that the two priests have been rescued from the den of the hoodlums. Immediately the incident happened, we have deployed our men to comb the forest, it was when we closed in on them that they released the victims and ran away. “Even after they have been released, we are still after the bandits and very soon we will get them.”
