Dayo Ojerinde The Lagos State Deputy Governor, Dr Obafemi Hamzat, has urged beneficiaries of the state’s Agro-Processing Productivity Enhancement and Livelihood Support project to develop viable business plans that will not just make them agropreneurs but also employers of labour. He gave the advice at the graduation of the Batch 1 of the 1,620 beneficiaries of the women and youth empowerment scheme of the project at the Lagos Agriculture Institute, Araga, Epe. The deputy governor, who was represented by the Chairman, Epe Local Government Area, Mr Adedoyin Adesanya, said the APPEALS project was aimed at supporting farmers. He urged the beneficiaries to avail themselves of several opportunities provided by the collaboration involving the Federal Government, the state governments and the World Bank to move up the ladder in agribusiness. Hamzat congratulated the beneficiaries of the first batch of APPEALS project empowerment programme, describing their success at the selection stage as a great feat. He said, “Being here today as beneficiaries of the APPEALS project women and youth empowerment programme is a major feat after being selected out of the over 7,000 applicants for the available 1,700 slots.” The Lagos State Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Gbolahan Lawal, said the main thrust of the APPEALS project was to increase productivity, as well as improve processing and marketing of the value chains. The State Project Coordinator, APPEALS project, Mrs Oluranti Sagoe-Oviebo, said the beneficiaries would soon become major contributors in the food production and supply chain in Lagos.
