Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti The Peoples Democratic Party in Ekiti State alleged on Thursday that the ruling All Progressives Congress in the state had perfected plans to use thugs to snatch election materials during Saturday’s local government elections. The party made the allegation in a statement in Ado Ekiti by its Publicity Secretary, Jackson Adebayo. It said any attempt to carry out such plan would be resisted. The statement read, “The party’s inability to stop the PDP candidates from participating in the elections has led to the meeting where a decision was reached to resort to ballot stuffing and hijacking of election materials across the state. “No amount of intimidation will change the determination of the PDP candidates to participate and win the local government elections on Saturday. “We advise members of the APC to drop the idea of thuggery in order not to turn the state into a war zone. “We are also calling on all security agencies that will participate in the election to orientate their men not to allow themselves to be used as guards by the APC to carry out rigging in the elections because that’s the boast of every member of the APC now in the state.” The APC State Publicity Secretary, Ade Ajayi, said the PDP was only afraid since it was not popular in the state. He said the partywould be routed out of the state with the APC’s victory in the 16 chairmanship seats and 177 councillorship positions. Copyright PUNCH.
