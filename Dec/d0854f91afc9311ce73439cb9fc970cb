Ted Odogwu,Kano Kano kingmakers, on Tuesday, filed a motion on notice before the Kano  State High Court, seeking an injunction   to  restrain Governor Abdullahi Ganduje from inaugurating the state council of chiefs. In the suit, the kingmakers also urged the court to restrain the traditional rulers, who constitute the membership of the state council of chiefs, from parading themselves in such capacities, pursuant to the newly-promulgated Kano State Emirates Council Laws, 2019. The kingmakers, led by Yususf Nabahani (Madakin Kano), pointed the court’s attention to a subsisting suit challenging the creation of four new emirates by Ganduje. They prayed the court to stop Ganduje from inaugurating the newly constituted council of chief, pending the determination of the suit. They also prayed the court to restrain the Kano State governor form deposing the Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II. They also prayed for a court order restraining the Emir of Kano from presiding over the   inauguration and the maiden meeting of the Kano  State Council of Chiefs. Copyright PUNCH.
