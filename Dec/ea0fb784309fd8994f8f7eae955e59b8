PANDORA, the world’s bestselling jewellery brand, is celebrating five years in Nigeria. According to a statement from the company, the Regional Manager, Oluwatosin Ogunade, said to mark the day, PANDORA is rewarding its clients with vouchers worth N100,000, N75,000 and N50,000 for three lucky winners amongst other prizes for purchases made between November 18 to 30, 2019. Winners will be announced at PANDORA outlet, The Palms Mall, Lekki on December 1, 2019. Ogunade said, “When we opened our first store in Lagos, we were both excited and nervous; excited about bringing one of the biggest brands here and nervous about the brand’s reception. We wondered if Nigerians would take to the concept and the largely romantic design. “Fortunately, any fears were unfounded. Good quality and design that inspires a woman, is relevant to her and maybe even given to her by a loved one, will always be worn by her”. The company has since grown to 11 outlets with eight stores in Nigeria and three in Ghana. While the journey has been far from easy, the company prides itself of its remarkable staff and leadership.
