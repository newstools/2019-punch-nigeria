In addition to purchases in November ahead of the December celebrations, the period was also marked by three months of border closure in which goods like rice were barred from coming into the country from neighbouring Republic of Benin, Niger and other countries. The border closure which came into effect on August 28 has seen prices of food increasing. Experts have said the border closure had made life difficult for an average Nigerian with very low purchasing power. The Director-General, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dr Muda Yusuf, had suggested that instead of a blanket closure, the capacity of local producers need to boosted while there was a phased closure,  just like they did for the cement sector. The Director- General, Nigeria Employers’ Consultative, Dr Timothy Olawale, said that things had become too expensive for the reach of an ordinary Nigerian worker in an economy where the government was yet to resolve the minimum wage issue. On his part, the Managing  Consultant and Chief Executive Officer, RTC Advisory Services Limited, Dr Vincent Nwani, advised the government to boost capacity of local producers so that they could produce in large quantity  the food items that were not allowed to come into the country.
