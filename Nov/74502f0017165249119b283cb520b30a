Chukwudi Akasike A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State, Senator Magnus Abe, has said that politics of bitterness and division was adversely affecting the development of the state. Abe also hailed the State Governor, Nyesom Wike, for taking measures to resolve the challenges facing the state. Speaking during a funeral of late Mrs. Fyna Atuzie-Boms, wife of the former Attorney General of Rivers State, Mr. Worgu Boms, at the Civic Centre in Port Harcourt on Saturday, Abe regretted that bitterness and hatred had come to characterise Rivers politic. He specifically observed that the situation was making it impossible for Rivers people to come together to fight for Rivers development.

I want to thank the Governor of Rivers State for leading by example. “I have always said Your Excellency should be a governor to all Rivers people; both those that like you and those who don’t. Those that voted for you and those who did not,” Abe said. He pointed out that while some people were looking for the causes of Rivers political challenges, Wike is seeking solutions.
