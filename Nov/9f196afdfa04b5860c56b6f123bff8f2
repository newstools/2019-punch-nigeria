Twitter users have told Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola that the fact that he could say Nigerian roads are not that bad reveals that he is not living in the same country with them. Fashola had on Wednesday, while briefing journalists, after the Federal Executive Council meeting in Abuja said that Nigerian roads were not as bad as being portrayed. He said, “The roads are not as bad as they are often portrayed. I know that this is going to be your headline, but the roads are not that bad.” Since his comment went viral, Nigerians have been bashing the former governor of Lagos State on the internet. A Twitter user, Amb Emmanuel Jr said, “Kidnapping in Nigeria is exaggerated – #AudioVP Osinbajo. There’s no hunger in the land – Minister of Agric Nanono. Nigerian roads not as bad as portrayed – Fashola. Obviously these people are living in a different Nigeria. Such a disconnection from reality.” Another said, “This man’s head has been corrupted by the allure of ministerial office. Take a look at Oju-Otukpo federal road, Oju-Awajir Road and Otukpo-Enugu road alone.” READ ALSO: Fashola says Nigerian roads not that bad, MAN, NECA disagree See more reactions:
