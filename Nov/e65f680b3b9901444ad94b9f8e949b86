Maiharaji Altine, Gusau The Zamfara State House of Assembly laid to rest the controversy surrounding the payment of pension and other entitlements to former governors, their deputies, speakers and their deputies by repealing the law on Tuesday. Presenting the bill before the House, the House leader, Faruk Dosara, urged his colleagues to, as a matter of urgency, consider the complete repeal of the law which provided the jamboree pay for the former political leaders of the state at the detriment of the retired civil servants who had not been paid their entitlements over the years. According to Dosara, the past leaders were collecting over N700m annually which “the state economy cannot accommodate for now.” [READ ALSO] Boko Haram: Allegation against Turkey, serious security issue, says DHQ Seconding the motion in the chamber, Tukur Tudu from the Bakura constituency, said the abolition of the law was necessary as it was detrimental “to the socio-economic well-being of our people.” After deliberations and contributions by the house members, the Speaker, Nasiru Magarya, ordered the Clerk of the House to give the bill first and second readings. Later, the House went for a committee of a whole and thereafter  the bill went for third reading during which it was passed. The House resolved that the bill should be sent to the governor for his assent. A lawmaker told our correspondent that with the passage, all past political leaders in the state would no longer enjoy any entitlement except as prescribed by the National Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission.
