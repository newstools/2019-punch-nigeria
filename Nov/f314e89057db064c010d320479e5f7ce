Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives on Thursday ordered the University of Maiduguri to suspend the plan to raise the fees imposed on students from 40 per cent to 400 per cent. The order was issued following the unanimous adoption of a motion moved by the Chief Whip, Mohammed Monguno, titled ‘Call to Put on Hold the Increase in Fees of University of Maiduguri.’ Adopting the motion, the lawmakers mandated the Committee on Tertiary Education and Services to engage the management of the University of Maiduguri “to stay action on the increment and to carry out an investigation on the matter in a bid to provide a lasting solution, and report back within four weeks for further legislative action.” READ ALSO: DSS receives court’s release warrants, holds Sowore, Bakare The Senate had last week also asked authorities of the University of Maiduguri to stay action on the fees increment.
