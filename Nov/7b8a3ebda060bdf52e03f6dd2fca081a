Gibson Achonu, Owerri The leader of Biafra Independent Movement, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike, has accused the Federal Government of masterminding the plan by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission to probe the Chief Executive Officer of Air Peace Limited, Chief Allen Onyema. Uwazuruike said the plan by the EFCC to open a probe against Onyema and the recent call by President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Assistant on Social Media, Loretta Onochie, asking Onyema to face his changes in the United States of America indicated that the FG was behind the probe. He said Onochie spoke the mind of the Presidency but warned that Ndigbo would rise against any plan to humiliate Onyema. The EFCC had, on Saturday, set up a special panel to look into the allegation of S44.9 million wire frauds and money laundering against Onyema.
