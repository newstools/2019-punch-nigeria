The Federal Road Safety Corps on Thursday made a U-turn on the use of Google map while driving. On Wednesday, the Sector Commander, Federal Capital Territory, Corps Commander Wobin Ayuba Gora had said that driving with the aid of Google map using mobile phones is a serious traffic offence. However, in a statement signed by Bisi Kazeem, the Corps Commander Public Education Officer, FRSC said that Gora was “quoted out of context on the use of google map app while driving.” Part of the statement said, “The Corps wishes to state that the Sector Commander must have been misquoted and his statement outrightly misrepresented because the Federal Road Safety Corps as a technology-driven organisation is not and has never stood against the use of google map by motorists.

The statement he made during the flag off buttresses the position of the Corps, which is that any driver who intends to deploy the use of Google map while driving must have it set on the phone before embarking on the journey, not while the vehicle is already in motion as this could be dangerous to the driver and other road users, and can lead to road traffic crash. “We say this because, available records have shown that use of phone for whatever purpose; be it text, voice calls, chats, browsing, setting google map to find location etc while driving could be distractive and can easily lead to loss of concentration. This has led to many road traffic crashes with attendant loss of lives and properties. “On the strength of this, the Federal Road Safety Corps wishes to reiterate its position on use of phone while driving as a dangerous and hazardous road traffic behaviour which has led to unwanted and avoidable road crashes. “We, therefore, call on all motorists who intend to deploy the use of google map on their phone especially during the festive season when traffic density is high, to activate such before setting the vehicle in motion so as to ensure 100 per cent concentration on the wheels.”
