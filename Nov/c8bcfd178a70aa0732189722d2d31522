Sola Shittu, Benin The Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu has said that there was no way he would have betrayed his political godfather and mentor, the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole. He made this claim in light of an earlier allegation levelled against him by the APC boss, that he was the mastermind of attacks in Iyahmo, his hometown, during the recent convocation in Edo University. However,  Shaibu speaking through his Chief Press Secretary, Musa Ebomhiana, said Oshiomhole is one person Shaibu holds in high regard. “So, he could not have betrayed him in any way. Rather, in all sense of responsibility,  I will say that the Deputy Governor is following the path set by his political godfather.

He also taught him that the people should lead politically. “As an obedient son and a good student of Oshiomhole school of politics, the deputy governor will not deviate from these. In view of this, I don’t want to believe that our leader and National  Chairman of our great party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has said that his political son and deputy governor of Edo State betrayed him for whatever reason. Our chairman may have been misquoted,” he said.
