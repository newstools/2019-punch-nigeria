Samuel Awoyinfa Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc has rewarded a couple, Mr and Mrs David Olaleye, with an all-expense-paid trip to Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. According to a statement from the company, the couple emerged winners in the ‘Golden Penny Feed Your Love’ campaign. The couple was presented to the media by the Managing Director, Foods Division, Mr Devlin Hainsworth, and the Head of Marketing, Rita Tsehai, at the head office of the company in Apapa, Lagos. Tsehai said the campaign was held through the social media, in which newly wedded couples uploaded some of their videos. This elicited responses from those who watched them. He said the campaign ran between July and October 2019, and the Olaleyes won the grand prize. Tsehai said during the campaign period, Golden Penny food products crew attended the wedding of seven couples across six cities in Nigeria. These cities are Lagos, Ibadan, Akure, Edo, Warri and Kaduna. In each of the locations visited, guests were treated to several sumptuous local delicacies prepared by the “Feed Your Love” catering team, led by Instagram influencer, Gina Ehikodu. She said, “Several entries were received, but only seven of these entries were adjudged winners after their posts received the highest interactions.” “We are always delighted to welcome new households into the Golden Penny Family,” said Tsehai during the presentation ceremony.
