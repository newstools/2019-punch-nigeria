Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Appeal Court in Owerri on Thursday upheld the electoral victory of Senator Rochas Okorocha, of Imo West senatorial district. The chairman of the panel, R.A Ada, who read the judgment said that the appeals filed by Senator Osita Izunaso of the All Progressives Grand Alliance and Jones Onyereri of the Peoples Democratic Party against Okorocha lacked merit. The jurist contended that the judgment of the lower court (Tribunal) which upheld Okorocha’s election was in order. The panel said that the petitioners could not prove their allegations of violence, over-voting, mutilation of electoral results and hijacking of electoral officers.
