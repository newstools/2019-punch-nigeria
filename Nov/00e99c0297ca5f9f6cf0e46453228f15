He said, “All the heads of the government agencies that are involved in enforcing laws of the state, we have come together to let any lawless members of the community know that Lagos of today won’t condone their lawlessness. “Because we are now together, you cannot hide under any agency to break laws. An officer of LASTMA can do the job of a KAI officer if he is the one present at the scene of the crime. All security agents across the state can get involved in maintaining law and order, notwithstanding their jurisdiction because we now work in synergy.” On his part, Opeifa, said, “We will monitor the enforcement agencies to ensure they don’t violate any fundamental rights or the laws establishing their agencies.” Copyright PUNCH.
