John Charles, Makurdi The Court of Appeal, Abuja Division,  will on Thursday (today) deliver judgment in the case filed by the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in Benue State, Emmanuel Jime, against Governor Samuel Ortom of the Peoples Democratic Party. The judgment date was contained in a hearing notice sent to parties in the case. Recall that a five-man panel of the Court of Appeal presided over by Justice O.A. Belgore had last Thursday reserved judgment in the appeal after listening to the arguments from counsel to the parties in the case. The movement of the hearing of the case from the Appeal Court, Makurdi Division, to the Abuja Division caused anxiety, with the state chapter of the PDP expressing concerns. It was gathered on Wednesday that  top government officials had relocated to Abuja for the judgment. The APC and its candidate had asked the appellate court to set aside the judgment of the election petitions tribunal which upheld Ortom’s re-elect. Copyright PUNCH.
