The commission said they were still awaiting results from Lokoja and Ibaji council
areas. It also added that clarification on result from Dekina was needed. However, with the results announced on Sunday, Bello of the All Progressives Congress was cruising to an easy win over the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Musa Wada.
