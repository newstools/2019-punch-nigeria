Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The Head of the European Union Delegation to Nigeria, Ambassador Ketil Karlsen, has said the EU is in Nigeria to help deepen democracy and not to support any political party or candidate. Addressing a press conference in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital, on Friday ahead of the governorship election in Kogi and Bayelsa states, Karlsen said the EU realised the importance of democracy as an important tool of social development and freedom, and decided to deploy human and capital resources to help entrench democratic values in Africa and Nigeria in particular. “It is on this note the delegation, with representatives in Kogi and Bayelsa states having been around for some time now, had engaged security agencies and civil society organisations on the need for a peaceful and credible election that will meet international standards,” he said. He urged political parties in the two states to translate the peace accords they had signed into reality, stating that the legitimacy of any democratically elected leader hinged on a credible election. Karlsen urged voters to come out en masse and vote the candidates of their choice in today’s governorship election. The EU also appealed to security agencies to maintain neutrality in the discharge of their duties and within the framework of the electoral laws. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
