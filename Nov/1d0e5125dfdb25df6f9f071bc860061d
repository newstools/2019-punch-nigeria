Sola Shittu, Benin The Nigerian Bar Association, Benin branch, on Wednesday commenced a three-day boycott of courts to protest against the kidnap of Justice Chioma Iheme-Nwosu. The Chairman, NBA, Benin branch, Collins Ogiebgean, said the court boycott would last till Friday. He stated that if by then the abducted judge remained in captivity, members of the body would have no option but to extend the boycott. Ogiebgean said, “We are calling on the state government and heads of security agencies to live up to their responsibilities and go the extra mile to see that Justice Chioma Iheme-Nwosu is rescued and that this should be the last time such a thing will happen. “It offends our senses as persons living in a society such as ours. If the orderly of a judge can be shot and the judge taken away in broad daylight, what happens to those of us who do not have security? “It is for this reason that we have resolved to protest. Accordingly, with effect from Wednesday, November 6, we shall proceed on a boycott of all courts in Edo State. No lawyer is permitted to appear in any of the courts. This is in solidarity with Justice Chioma Iheme-Nwosu.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
