Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Lagos State Special Offences Court in Ikeja has fixed the trial of an oil marketer and pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Ayodeji Oluokun for December 10. He is facing trial for allegedly issuing dud cheques of $1.6m. Oluokun was arraigned alongside his oil firm, Peak Petroleum Industry Nigeria Limited, on two counts bordering on the issuance of dud cheques to the tune of $1.6m by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. According to the EFCC, the defendant approached the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of GOSL Nigeria Limited, Emmanuel Ekpeyong, for loans of $1m and $666,666 to enable him carry out operational activities in his companyâ€™s oil field in Bayelsa State and assured the complainant that he would repay the money within a year. The defendant was alleged to have issued two post-dated Standard Chartered Bank Nigeria Limited cheques on June 26, 2014, for the sums of $1m and $666,666, but when the cheques were presented for payment, they were returned due to insufficient funds in the account of the drawer.
