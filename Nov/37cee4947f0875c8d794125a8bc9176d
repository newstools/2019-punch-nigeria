Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives on Thursday made a U-turn on the Operation Positive Identification by the Nigerian Army, asking the military to go on with the exercise. The House, however, asked that the Nigeria Police Force should lead the exercise. This is part of the recommendations by the House Committee on Army, led by Mr Abdurazak Namdas, which was mandated to investigate the OPI and guide the chamber on the legislative action to be taken on it. Meanwhile, the House summoned the factional leader of the Peoples Democratic Party caucus, Kingsley Chinda for claiming minority leadership positions with three other lawmakers in breach of the chambers rules.
