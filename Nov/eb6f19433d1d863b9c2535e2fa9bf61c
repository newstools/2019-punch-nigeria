Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Court of Appeal in Abuja on Monday upheld the second term election of Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State. A five-man panel of the court led by Justice C.N. Uwa dismissed the appeal by the All Progressives Congress and its governorship candidate in the March 9, 2019 poll, Abubakar Danladi. The court affirmed the judgment of the Taraba State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal, which had dismissed the petition by the APC challenging Ishaku’s re-election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. A three-man panel of the tribunal led by Justice M.O. Adewara had in its unanimous judgment delivered on September 20, 2019, dismissed the petition filed by the APC and Danladi. The appellate court ruled on Monday, “I hold that the appellant had no candidate in the March 9 governorship election in Taraba State since it did not sponsor a competent candidate. “I hold that the appeal is unmeritorious and is hereby dismissed. The judgment of the tribunal is affirmed. Parties are to bear their cost.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
