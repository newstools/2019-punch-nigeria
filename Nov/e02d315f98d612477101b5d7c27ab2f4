Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna Tension enveloped Kaduna metropolis on Sunday following the demolition of some houses in five communities in the Chikun Local Government Area of the state by the Kaduna State Urban Planning and Development Agency. The houses were demolished because “they were illegally constructed by the residents.’ While a few of the demolished houses were under construction, others had been completed. Residents of Baban Saura, Anguwan Waziri, Karji, Tsohon Kamanz and  Angwan Maigyero, claimed that KASUPDA officials, accompanied by security operatives, stormed the area midnight Saturday to demolish the houses. This, according to Yusuf Zomo, who spoke on behalf of residents of the communities at a press conference, was without prior notice. Zomo said, “Initially, they said they don’t want to see containers by the roadsides; owners of containers were directed to remove them from by the road. “At about 12 midnight on Friday when everybody was sleeping, they (KASUPDA ) moved in with caterpillars and bulldozers.” But the Director-General of KASUPDA, Ismaila Dikko, said  despite several notices of  warning since 2012, the residents never stopped building in the areas affected.
