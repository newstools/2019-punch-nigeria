A 41- year-old housewife, Janet Ojukwu, was on Tuesday arraigned in Lagos for allegedly pouring hot water on her husband’s ex-wife. Janet, who resides at Makoko area of Yaba, Lagos, is facing a charge of assault occasioning harm before a Yaba Magistrates’ Court. She, however, pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, Sgt. Godwin Oriabure, told the court that the defendant committed the offence at 3p.m. on November 3, at No. 7, Imamehin St., Makoko, Yaba. Oriabure said the complainant, Mrs. Grace Onuoha, had taken her daughter to her ex-husband’s house to collect some clothes, when the defendant attacked her. He said that Janet poured a bucket of hot water on Onuoha’s face, accusing her of trying to snatch her husband back. “The complainant was rushed to the hospital and has been on admission,” Oriabure said. He said the offence contravened Section 173 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Section 173 stipulates three-year jail term for “assault occasioning harm.” The Magistrate, Mrs. S.O. Obasa, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N20,000, with two sureties in like sum. Obasa said that both sureties must be gainfully employed with evidence of two-year tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She adjourned the case until December 12 for mention. (NAN)
