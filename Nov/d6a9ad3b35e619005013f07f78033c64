Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Senator, who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the 8th National Assembly, Shehu Sani, has said the social media bill in the red chamber was a threat to the fundamental rights of Nigerians. Sani, who is now the Executive Director, African Centre for Peace and Development, said this in a statement on Wednesday. He wondered why the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration which got to power in 2015 largely due to social media support, was now trying to gag their activities. He said, “The Bill on the regulation of social media poses a serious threat and danger to freedom of speech and expression. “The quest to regulate social media is a grand plan to silence critics and dissenting voices. “Combatting hate speech is a smokescreen to annihilate free speech.

He said, “Disobedience of court orders demonises a country and criminalises a government. “Nigeria’s democracy is threatened by the authoritarian tendencies of the people in power.” Sani demanded the immediate release of Omoyele Sowore and all those still being held despite a valid court order. He said, “There is a cloud of fear over our country and the moral flag of our democracy is lowered to half staff. “There is the urgency to defend our freedom and democracy against those standing against it.”
