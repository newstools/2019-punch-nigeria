The Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari did not relegate Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo by traveling without transmitting a letter to the National Assembly to empower the VP to act in his absence. Omoworare stated this while briefing news men in Abuja on Wednesday. News Agency of Nigeria reports that the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, had, on Tuesday, said that the President could “rule from anywhere.” NAN also reports that Buhari had, on November 2, 2019, embarked on a “private visit” to London. He is expected to return to Nigeria on November 17. Omoworare said that contrary to agitations by some individuals and groups, the President had not, in any way, undermined or relegated the office of the Vice President. “He has no reason to do so. I don’t think there is any way or manner that the office of the Vice President has been relegated. “The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria can work from anywhere he is in the world,” he said. Omoworare insisted that the only case where people could raise issues was when a President was ill and was unable to transmit his absence to the National Assembly. “The only celebrated case was that of the late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, who was ill and could not transmit any letter to the National Assembly. “The National Assembly had to work round the situation by ensuring that executive powers go to the Vice President,” Omoworare said. He said the present circumstance was different from the Yar’Adua era and that Buhari did not breach any law by not transmitting a letter to the National Assembly to enable the VP exercise executive powers while on his ongoing private trip to London.
