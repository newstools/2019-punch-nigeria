Oladimeji Ramon The office of Archbishop of Canterbury says it has noted the concerns raised by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project on the continued detention of #RevolutionNow protest convener, Omoyele Sowore, and Bakare Olawale, by the Department of State Services despite that the two men have been granted bail by the court. SERAP’s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oludare, said the group received an acknowledgement email from the Chief Correspondence Officer at the Lambeth Palace, Dominic Goodall. The email was in response to SERAP’s call last week on the Archbishop of Canterbury, Most Revd Justin Portal Welby, to “use his good offices and leadership and his friendship with President Muhammadu Buhari to prevail on him to obey court orders most recently involving activists Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare who remain in arbitrary detention despite a court order for their release.” READ ALSO: Court orders IGP to release details of 80,115 ghost police officers Acknowledging SERAP’s open letter, Goodall said the archbishop was unable to “respond personally in detail.” He said, “Thank you for taking the time to share your comments and concerns on this matter, which have been noted. Please be assured that I will communicate your concerns to the Archbishop and his staff team, so that they are aware of your concerns. Thank you again for taking the time to write.” Oludare said SERAP “is delighted that our letter and the concerns that it raised have caught the attention of the Archbishop.” He said, “Given his public record for justice and human rights, we have absolutely no doubt that he will prevail on President Buhari to obey not just the court order for the release of Sowore and Bakare but all court orders. “But it should never have reached this level, as the government ought to have obeyed court orders as a matter of routine.”
