Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri A 20-year-old man, Emmanuel Osundu, and his 22-year-old accomplice, Christigous Odinaka, have been arrested for the kidnap and murder of David Ikechukwu, 23. The Imo State Commissioner of Police, Rabiu Ladodo, who paraded the suspects before newsmen at the command headquarters in Owerri, described the murder of the victim as most unfortunate. Ladodo said the suspects lured the victim out, killed him after robbing him, and dumped his corpse in a forest at Mbutu in the Aboh Mbaise Local Government Area of the state. He said the operatives of the Anti-Kidnapping Unit of the command arrested the suspects after painstaking investigation. The CP stated that the suspects would be prosecuted to serve as deterrent to other youths, who see crime as a way of life. Ladodo stated, “Sequel to the report that one David Ikechukwu, 23, of Logara, Ngor Okpala Local Government Area of Imo State went missing since November 10, the Anti-Kidnapping Unit swung into action and these suspects were arrested. “They have confessed to the crime and disclosed how they lured the victim out, killed him and robbed him of his Kasea motorcycle, GSM phone and money. “The suspects also led the police to a forest in Mbutu, Aboh Mbaise Local Government Area, where the corpse of the victim was dumped and subsequently recovered his corpse.” When interviewed, the suspects simply said they committed the crime.
