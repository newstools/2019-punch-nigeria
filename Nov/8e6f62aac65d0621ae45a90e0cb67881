Sola Shittu, Benin The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has sworn in his senior special assistants and special assistants, urging them to see their appointments as a call to service and be accountable to the people. The aides were drawn from the 192 wards of the 18 local government areas of the state. Obaseki had recently sacked over 200 advisers with a promise to reappoint fresh ones within 30 days. Speaking during the swearing-in on Thursday in Benin City, the governor said the primary assignment for the appointees included deepening the policies and achievements of his administration at the grass-roots level. Obaseki said, “Our focus is on service. How do we serve our people? How do we get the lives of our people to be better? You have been called to serve and not to enrich yourself. “Our government has zero tolerance for corruption and incompetence. If you are found culpable in acts of corruption and absconding from your duty post or incompetent, we will not hesitate to drop you.” He noted that with dwindling national resources, there was a need to fully harness the resources in the state, urging the appointees to come up with developmental initiatives that would benefit their wards. The governor noted that he was not involved in the nomination process of the appointees but they were selected by the APC leaders at the ward and LGA levels. In his remarks, the Edo Chairman of the All Progressive Congress, Anselm Ojezua, said the appointment of the SSAs and SAs was done through the party structure at the ward and LGA levels and in accordance with the party mantra of ‘let the people lead.’ Copyright PUNCH.
