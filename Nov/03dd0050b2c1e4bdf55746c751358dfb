Ada Wodu, Calabar As Governor of Cross River State, Prof. Ben Ayade, begins the process to form his cabinet, former commissioners are likely to constitute the bulk of the new cabinet. This is likely to be the case as names of two of the three commissioner-nominees the governor sent to the state House of Assembly for approval were former commissioners in the immediate past cabinet. The nominees are former Commissioner for Finance, Asuquo Ekpenyong and former Commissioner for Commerce and Industry, Peter Egba. The third commissioner-nominee is Tanko Ashang, a governorship aspirant in 2015 who also served briefly in former Governor Liyel Imoke’s government. One of the sources said, “What is delaying the full composition of the cabinet is the ongoing consultation with stakeholders in the 18 local government areas of the state.” Copyright PUNCH.
