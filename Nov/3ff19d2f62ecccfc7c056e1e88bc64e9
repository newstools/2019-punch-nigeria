Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has accused the state branch of the Nigerian Bar Association of descending into the political arena by issuing politically motivated ultimatums on security in the state. Addressing a special court session during opening of the 2019/2020 Legal Year of the Rivers State Judiciary in Port Harcourt on Friday, Wike regretted that the NBA crossed the redline by playing politics with the security situation. He said, “We wish to warn that by descending into the arena of politics with irresponsible ultimatums, threats and utterances, the NBA in Rivers State has crossed the line and become part of the enemy of our people.” READ ALSO: Kukah warns Buhari against social media regulation The governor said the NBA in Rivers State failed to defend the state’s courts and the rule of law when they were subjected to undeserved assaults and abuse by the powers that be. “The NBA kept quiet when they closed down our courts in 2013. It lost its voice and remained indifferent when the homes of judges were brazenly attacked in the dead of night by security agents.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
