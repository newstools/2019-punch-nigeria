The Chairman, China Railway Construction Company, Mr Chen Fenjian, has assured Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of the support of Chinese business community in his effort to sustain the state’s infrastructural development. Fenjian, who is also the Secretary of Communist Party of China, made this disclosure to the governor during a meeting at the CRCC headquarters in Beijing, according to a statement made available by the Lagos State Government on Sunday. He called on the company’s management to increase its collaboration with the Lagos State Government in the areas of infrastructure and urban development. Sanwo-Olu, after expressing appreciation to the company’s leadership for their contributions and investment in Nigeria, requested the Chinese businessmen to do more for Nigeria to sustain its growth and socio-economic stability. He said, “I admit that the CRCC has made significant contributions and investment towards development of Nigeria. “As an individual who has been in government before now, I know full well that it is not every project that government has funding for, but delivering projects is a major responsibility of the government.” Sanwo-Olu added that Lagos State had a number of projects that could be taken up through competitive and rigorous bidding process.
