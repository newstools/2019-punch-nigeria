Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja The Nigeria Customs Service has said it will donate seized bags of rice and other healthy consumables to internally displaced persons It also disclosed that following the partial closure of the nation’s borders, over N3bn worth of items had been seized by the operatives of the Service. The Public Relations Officer, NCS, Mr Joseph Attah, stated this while responding to enquiries by our correspondent on Friday in Abuja. He said, “Those seized items that are not good for human consumption will be destroyed and those ones that are okay will be treated like other seized items are treated. “They will go through judicial process and if they are condemned, they are forfeited to the Federal Government and then disposed off. “But those ones that are not harmful will be given to the IDPs. If they are dangerous drugs, they are destroyed, if it’s a vehicle, they are auctioned.” Attah had in an interview with Saturday PUNCH listed some of the items seized as “437,225 jerrycans of premium motor spirit, popularly known as petrol, 363 vehicles, 32,814 bags of rice as well as drugs, ammunition and guns.” While some stakeholders and analysts have described the closure as a setback to the quest for Africa’s integration, others, especially farmers, described it as a move in the positive direction. The Federal Government had in August closed its borders to neighboring countries in an exercise code-named Operation Exercise Swift Response. The action which resulted in joint border operations by security agencies had been greeted by mixed reactions. Attah said that since the closure of the border, the monetary value of items seized was over N3bn. Copyright PUNCH.
