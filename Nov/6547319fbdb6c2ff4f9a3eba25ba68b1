John Ameh, Abuja The Federal Government has admitted that the closure of the country’s land borders is contributing to rising inflation. According to recent figures from the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics, the headline inflation stood at 11.61 per cent as of October. The Minister of Finance/Budget /National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, told State House Correspondents that inflation rose due to hikes in food prices arising from border closure. She was responding to questions after the Federal Executive Council in Abuja. Ahmed said, “Now headline inflation is at about 11:61 per cent as of the end of October. The slight increase in inflation between September and October is due to food inflation. “And part of the reason is the border closure, but the border closure is very short and temporary and the increase is just about two basis point.” READ ALSO: Buhari, ministers hold FEC meeting The FEC meeting was presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.
