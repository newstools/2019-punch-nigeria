I want to implore the media to be wary of fake news trending on social media and carry out proper investigation on any issue before going to the press. “The development also shows that Nigerians no longer value the lives of fellow humans who die in such manner,” Chukwura remarked. On the ember months, she called on all stakeholders to rally support for the corps in entrenching the culture of safe use of Nigerian roads.
