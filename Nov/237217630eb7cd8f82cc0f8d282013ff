He said, “I have helped people to take ransom to the kidnappers three times. The first time, the kidnappers rewarded me with N100,000; the second time, they gave me N50,000, but the third time, they didn’t give me anything. “I know nothing about the policemen the kidnappers killed. God and the police woman, who was released are my witnesses. “When I took the ransom to them, that was the third time I took ransom to the kidnappers, but they refused to give me the policeman.” He added, “I and the other policewoman cried and begged them but they refused. They said the policeman use to insult them. That day, they even collected my phone and they didn’t give me money that day.” Copyright PUNCH.
