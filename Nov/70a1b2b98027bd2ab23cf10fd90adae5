Sunday Aborisade, Abuja The Senate on Thursday asked the ministers of agriculture and solid minerals to come up with their four-year plans aimed at diversifying the nation’s economy. The upper chamber noted that both ministries should unveil their road maps at roundtable conferences with critical stakeholders in the sectors which must hold in  the first week of December this year. The senate’s request for the four-year plans from both ministries on diversification followed a motion sponsored by Senator Ibikunle Amosun. Amosun’s  motion was titled, “The need for continuous implementation of policy reforms for the diversification of the Nigerian economy through the agricultural and solid minerals sectors.” The senator said the two sectors held the secret to the current efforts by the Federal Government to diversify the Nigerian economy and also lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years. Virtually all the senators who contributed to debate on the motion, supported the need for the Federal Government to expedite action on its diversification policy using the two sectors as the driving force. The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, said heads of agriculture and solid minerals ministries should come up with road maps on what they wanted to achieve within the next four years on the diversification policy.
