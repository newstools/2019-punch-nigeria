We also got reports of direct attacks on some politically-exposed persons with the intent of terminating their lives. “As a government, we will give security agencies every support to track down and prosecute those who hid under politics to perpetrate crime. “But beyond that, we will compensate families that lost loved ones and properties. We know nothing could pay for the life of a human; but as a government, our hearts are with those bereaved families.”
