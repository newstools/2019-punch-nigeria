The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100 million stellar black holes but LB-1 is twice as massive as anything scientists thought possible, said Liu Jifeng, a National Astronomical Observatory of China professor who led the research. “Black holes of such mass should not even exist in our galaxy, according to most of the current models of stellar evolution,” he added. Scientists generally believe that there are two types of black holes.

Astronomers are still only beginning to grasp “the abundance of black holes and the mechanisms by which they form,” David Reitze, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) who was not involved in the discovery, told AFP. LB-1’s large mass falls into a range “known as the ‘pair instability gap’ where supernovae should not have produced it”, Reitze said. “That means that this is a new kind a black hole, formed by another physical mechanism!” LB-1 was discovered by an international team of scientists using China’s sophisticated LAMOST telescope. Additional images from two of the world’s largest optical telescopes — Spain’s Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Keck I telescope in the United States — confirmed the size of LB-1, which the National Astronomical Observatory of China said was “nothing short of fantastic”. Scientists have tended to find black holes by detecting the X-rays they emit. This method has been used for decades without much success due to the limitations of the available equipment, Liu added. But LAMOST, constructed between 2001 and 2008 in north China’s Hebei province, allows researchers to detect up to 4,000 stars simultaneously with each exposure, making it one of the world’s most powerful ground-based telescopes. Liu told AFP the method used to discover LB-1 could help scientists identify many more black holes in the future. Out of the 100 million black holes believed to exist in our galaxy, Liu said, only 4,000 “can give you X-rays that can be detected by us”. (AFP)
