Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Monday said he would avoid any project that would address only the needs of any political actor in the state in the proposed 2020 Budget. Abiodun also pledged that “no vanity project” would feature in the 2020 Budget being compiled for presentation to the state House of Assembly. The governor said this while declaring open the 2020 Treasury Board meeting held at the Oba’s Complex, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. He said, “We must realise that our responsibilities to the people of our state go beyond channelling efforts towards the routine pattern of using public resources for those in power. “We must devise a system of strategic allocation of resources which will ensure that politics is secondary. Projects and programmes of government in the first full budget that we are preparing would have impact on the people who are the essence of government.” He noted that public servants’ duties go beyond mere allocation of resources, but to ensure programmes that would be meaningful to the people. He challenged public servants to join him in devising ways of allocating resources to government policies, projects and programmes that have direct impact on the lives of the people and not those meant to massage people’s ego. He said “All the expenditures are going to be targeted at programmes and projects aimed at the continued development of our state and creating more prosperity for the people.” Copyright PUNCH.
