Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja Indications have emerged that telecommunications operators in the country are not furnishing the Ministry of Works with the location of their fibre cables as directed by the Federal Government. It was gathered that the ministry asked for the information in order to capture the location of the telecoms facilities in road construction and rehabilitation projects. A source in the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy informed our correspondent that the telcos were asked to present detailed drawings of the locations where they laid their fibre cables. The telcos were also asked to notify the ministry and obtain approval, before laying new fibre cables. However, the source, who did not wish to be named, told our correspondent that the directive was not being complied with. It was gathered that the directive followed complaints by the telcos that their fibre cables were usually cut and damaged in the course of road construction and rehabilitation projects undertaken by the government. “The Ministry of Works intends to incorporate the location of the fibre cables into whatever designs they are doing for the roads in order to forestall the cutting of fibre cables because once you cut the fibre cables, it is destroyed,” the source said. Disruption in telecommunications services has often been traced to cut in optic fibre cables in the process of road construction. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
