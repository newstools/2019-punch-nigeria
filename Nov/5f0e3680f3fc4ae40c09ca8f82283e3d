Peter Dada, Akure The Federal University of Technology, Akure, Ondo State, has expelled six students who brutalised a female student, Boluwatife, outside the campus of the institution a few weeks ago. The expelled students are, Popoola Olaniyi, Oluwadare Tobiloba, Nandi Jessica, Ajuwon Emmanuella, Emmanuel Taiwo and Alao Cecilia. The six sanctioned students were reported to have brutalised Boluwatife following an allegation that she gossipped about one of them at a hostel outside the campus of the university. It was gathered that the institution’s action against the erring students followed the report of the disciplinary panel set up by the management of the institution on the matter. The development was confirmed by the Deputy Director, Corporate Communications of the FUTA, Mr Adegbenro Adebanjo, in a statement issued on Tuesday in Akure, the Ondo State capital. According to the statement, the expulsion of the students was in line with the institution’s rules and regulations. The statement read, “The expulsion is sequel to the recommendation of an investigative panel which probed the incident that took place in an off-campus hostel on Saturday, November 16, 2019. “The expulsion is in line with the position of page 48 of the 2019/2020 students handbook which prescribes expulsion from the university for students who engage in, physical assault or battery on another student outside the university premises. As a consequence of their expulsion, their studentship of FUTA ceases forthwith with all its rights and privileges. “The punishment meted out to the affected students is not to pander to the justifiable public outcry that greeted their odious act but in tandem with the rules and regulations as contained in the students’ code of conduct as stipulated in the university handbook and oath of matriculation which all students are made to sign and subscribe to. ” Adegbenro also reiterated that the university had zero tolerance for indiscipline.
