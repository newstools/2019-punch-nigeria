Tunde Oyekola The National Assembly has been called upon to repeal the Pension Reform Act 2014. The call was contained in a resolution made at the National Executive Council meeting of the Senior Staff Association of Statutory Corporations and Government-owned companies held in Ilorin on Friday. The Association, in a communiqué signed jointly by its President, Comrade Mohammed Yunusa, and Secretary, Dr Ayo Olorunfemi, called on PENCOM to explain to Nigerian workers the change in its rules on payment after retirement. The association said, “Retiring workers have complained of their inability to access their contributory pension even one year after retirement. “Hence, we hereby call on the National Assembly to as a matter of urgency to commence the repeal of the Pension Reform Act, 2014.” It also called on Federal and state governments not to appoint politicians as the chief executive officers of statutory corporations and government-owned companies, noting that such appointments were only used for political settlements rather than performance.
