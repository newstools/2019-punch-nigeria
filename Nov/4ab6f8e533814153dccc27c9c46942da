Raphael Ede, Enugu The Enugu state police command on Tuesday paraded one Pastor Sunday Egbo, the founder of Christ Mercy Ministry, Ajuona Obukpa, in Nsukka Local government Area of the state for the alleged rape of a member of his church. Parading the suspect along 36 other suspects at the Police Headquarters, the Police Commissioner, Ahmed Abdur-rahman, said that the fake man of God had on November 9, 2019, allegedly invited one Ukwueze Ifebuche Blessing with the pretence of having a crusade on that faithful day by 6pm. According to the Commissioner, the suspect asked the victim to come along with the picture of her sick brother for prayers. “On arrival, the Pastor took her to his house and left with the pretence to go and bring other people who were supposed to come for the programme but returned about 11pm and dragged her to his room, brought out a magic Stone and threatened to kill her if she raised an alarm. “He ordered her to remove her clothes, she refused and the Pastor slapped her and forcefully tore her clothes and raped her,” Ahmed said. The police commissioner added, “The Pastor not satisfied, seized her pant, brazier and brought small a bottle and wanted to insert it into her private parts, and she struggled and ran naked to the door and shouted which attracted neighbours who came and invited the Police for her rescue and the Pastor was subsequently arrested.” The suspect confessed to committing the crime to journalists when he was asked to narrate why he was arrested by the police. Egbo said, “I actually raped her in my house.”
