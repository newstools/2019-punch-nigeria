John Ameh, Abuja Plateau State Governor, Mr Simon Lalong, on Friday mocked Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Lt-Gen Jerry Useni (retd), who contested the March governorship poll against him, saying that he (Useni) ought to be resting at home. Lalong, who was responding to the Court of Appeal decision confirming him as the winner of the poll, stated that Useni’s daughter was his classmate in school. Lalong, who spoke with State House Correspondents at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, said it was unfortunate that he had to contest the election against someone who was his ‘father.’ He spoke further, “I will say it again here; his daughter was my classmate, I have told him several times, his first daughter was my classmate. “So, at this stage, I would have been expecting his daughter to contest to be governor and not him. His daughter was my classmate. We went to school together and so why should we be fighting? Fighting him is like fighting a father; it is unfortunate. “For me, I say my focus is Plateau state. We have done that in the first election; he was defeated, he said no. He said they will go back for a rerun, I said let’s go back for a rerun. We went back for a rerun, I defeated him. He said no, he was going for the tribunal. We went to the first tribunal, he said he is a General, he doesn’t fight and retire, he will go to the Supreme Court.” Copyright PUNCH.
