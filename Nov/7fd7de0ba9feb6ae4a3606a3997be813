Hindi Livinus, Yola A faction of the Peoples Democratic Party has emerged in Adamawa State. The group known as Reformed PDP was convened by a former governorship candidate, Umar Ardo. Announcing the formation of the splinter group in Yola on Monday, Ardo said he and other stakeholders were setting up the parallel PDP and its structures allegedly on the grounds that the state executive committee of the party lacks legitimacy. He said against the provision of the constitution of the country and a valid court judgment, the party in the state went ahead to pass a law that allowed it to establish local government caretaker committees. Part of the grouse of the stakeholders who moved to form the Reformed PDP in the state is the appointment of nearly all the working committees’ members of the party at the local government level into positions as caretaker members at the council. Ardo said, “What we are having is an invalid executive council that is staying invalidly, unlawfully, illegally and unjustly. “It is against this background that some of us felt that this illegality must not be allowed to continue and therefore decided to form the Reformed PDP.” The splinter group, according to Ardo, has set up a 29-member steering committee which has up to 10 days to report on modalities for the establishment of a “state executive committee members for the Reformed PDP in the state.” But the state chairman of the PDP, Tahir Shehu, said Ardo should be ignored because he was no longer a member of the party, having been expelled by the PDP at his ward.
