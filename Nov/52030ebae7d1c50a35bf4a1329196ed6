Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria has inaugurated two committees and a board to enhance the output of professional engineers across the country. COREN’s President, Ali Rabiu, who inaugurated the committees and board at the council’s headquarters in Abuja, said the move was also aimed at raising the profile of Nigerian engineers within and outside the country. The council inaugurated the Committee on Regulations and Guidelines for Registration, Washington Accord Application Committee, as well as the Engineering Accreditation Board. On why the committee on regulations was formed, Rabiu said, “Council in seeking to enhance the process and procedure of registering both engineering practitioners and firms in line with global best practice, established the registration department within the registry. “As you are aware, one of the policies being encouraged by the Federal Government is ease of doing business; so, the council deems it fit that the registration process should be streamlined to conform to what is obtainable globally.” He said the Committee on Regulations and Guidelines for Registration was made up of nine members. On the Washington Accord Application Committee, Rabiu said the move was part of process being implemented by COREN to internationalise its engineering qualifications in order to enhance the mobility of its engineering practitioners by becoming a provisional signatory of the Washington Accord. “A lot of efforts and resources have already been spent by the council on this. Unfortunately, COREN is required to resubmit its application to the International Engineering Alliance.” CopyrightPUNCH.
