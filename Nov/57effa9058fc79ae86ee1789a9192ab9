Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja The Federal Government on Saturday announced the commencement of free train rides on the over $1.5bn new Lagos-Ibadan railway service.

The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, who announced this via his official Twitter handle, noted that the standard gauge rail line was ready for use. According to him, the free train ride would commence on Saturday (today), November 30, 2019, till the end of the first quarter of 2020.

Amaechi said, “Our free rides on the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail line will begin today (Saturday) and run through March 2020. “Commuters on that route can take advantage of it and save transportation during the festive period and beyond. Let’s ride on the #NextLevel. Take-off point is Iju.” The minister’s tweet was greeted with several reactions, as some of his followers lauded the move, while others criticised the development. Femi Otunba tweeted, “The lion of the Niger Delta, the Knight and the crusader of next level, thank you very much for not disappointing Nigeria and the peoples President, PMB.” But Adedayo Adeyemo did not see any sense in the arrangement, as he stated that “there will be overcrowding, no one to hold accountable for poor service as it is free. “Facility will be damaged due to overcrowded coaches and given that the train was procured through loan, how does free service help repay the loan?”
