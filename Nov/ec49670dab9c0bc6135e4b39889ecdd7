Peter Dada, Akure Some residents of the Ese Akoko community in the Akoko North-West Local Government Area of Ondo State have called on the state government to assist them following the rainstorm that wreaked havoc on the community. It was gathered that the incident, which occurred on Friday, rendered many residents of the community homeless, as the rainstorm destroyed many buildings, including churches. According to an eyewitness, properties worth millions of naira were destroyed by the rainstorm. In his reaction, the monarch of the town, Oba Daniel Adewumi, appealed to the National Emergency Management Agency and the state and local governments to come to the aid of the victims in the community. “This is the second time in recent times that rain would wreak havoc on the community without any assistance from any quarter. So, we are passionately appealing to the Federal Government for immediate relief for the affected people,” he said.
