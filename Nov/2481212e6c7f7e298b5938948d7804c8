Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday adjourned till November 21 hearing in a suit challenging the eligibility of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State to contest Saturday’s governorship election in the state. The suit was, on October 10 instituted by the Social Democratic Party’s candidate in the election, Natasha Akpoti, who urged the court to disqualify the governor from participating in the election for allegedly having double registration as a voter. Justice Inyang Ekwo, on Friday, adjourned the matter till November 21 to enable Bello to file his defence in the suit. The suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1221/2019 was filed on behalf of the plaintiff by Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN) with the Independent National Electoral Commission and the All Progressives Congress joined as the defendants. But Bello, through his lawyer, Mike Enahoro, filed a motion praying to be joined as a defendant, on Friday. Enahoro, who said he was only served with the motion on Friday, noted that he would oppose the motion, adding that it was filed to stall hearing of the case. While INEC’s lawyer, Alhassan Umar (SAN), said he had no objection to Bello’s motion, APC’s lawyer, Abdulwahab Mohammed, asked for time to study it. But the judge later urged the parties to allow Bello to be joined as a defendant, noting that the plaintiff was at liberty to raise the objection against Bello’s inclusion as a party, in his further written address.
