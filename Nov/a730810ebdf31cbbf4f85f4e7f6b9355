At least one person was confirmed dead, while others sustained injuries in a communal clash that broke out on Sunday at Okobaba, Ebute-Meta, Mainland Local Government Area of Lagos, where a fire incident had happened on Friday, November 8. Violent clash was said to have broken out in the early hours of Sunday between a group of truck pushers who specialise in scrap gathering, mainly Hausa youths, and some Odua Peoples Congress members. However, personnel of the Denton Police Station, Lagos State Command, raced to the scene of the clash and restored peace and order to the area. Narrating how the clash happened to the Lagos State Government team which visited the area on Sunday, leader of Hausa Youths in Okobaba, Mr. Hassan Ibrahim, said trouble started when some Hausa youths went to buy scraps from the burnt shanties. He said on their way back, they were “intercepted and harassed” by some “OPC miscreants” who demanded money before they could go with the scrap materials. “The youths resisted them,” Ibrahim told the government agents led by the Commissioner for Finance, Rabiu Olowo; and supported by that of Physical Planning and Urban Development, Idris Salako;  Special Adviser to the Governor on Civic Engagement, Aderemi Adebowale-Owoeye. They were accompanied by the Chairman, Lagos Mainland Local Government, Mrs. Omolola Essien. “In the process, fight broke out. One person was shot in the head and others who sustained injuries are currently receiving treatment at the Ebute-Meta Health Centre. The governor’s representatives pleaded for calm and cooperation among the warring parties and the fire victims, and urged them to maintain peaceful coexistence, shun conflict and violence. The governor’s delegation also visited the Ebute-Meta Health Centre, where those injured during the fracas were being treated. (NAN)
