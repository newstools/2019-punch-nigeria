Ademola Babalola, Ibadan Oyo State Government said on Thursday it would order road contractors of the immediate past administration of Senator Abiola Ajimobi back to site over what it termed ‘shoddy jobs’ across the state. The state Commissioner for Works and Transport, Prof Raphael Afonja, disclosed the plan during an inspection tour of Taki and Odo-Oru-NEPA roads in Ogbomoso on Wednesday. Afonja expressed displeasure at what he called the state of the roads constructed by the previous administration. He said, “The roads were not designed properly for the purpose they are meant to serve and the failure of the roads are of great concern to us. Therefore, we will look for the contractors that did the road works and bring them back to site to complete the jobs or be made to refund government money to its coffers. “The inspection of the roads was to yield to calls made by people for government’s intervention on the roads. As a responsive government, we owe the people the responsibility to come and see things for ourselves and proffer possible solutions. “We are assuring the people of Oyo State that any road construction project embarked upon by the Governor Seyi Makinde-led administration will stand the test of time to serve as example to others.” Copyright PUNCH.
