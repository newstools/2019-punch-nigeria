Umar Muhammed, Lafia About seven persons were said to have lost their lives in a boat accident on Friday evening in Gwayaka river in the Lafia East Development Area of Lafia Local government in Nasarawa State. PUNCH reports that the incident is coming barely a year after four died in a boat mishap in the Ashangwa area of Lafia East Development Area of the state. An eyewitness, who was at the scene of the incident informed our correspondent that the victims, who are mostly irrigation farmers from Kano, were returning from their farms that evening when the unfortunate took place. According to him, the canoe was overloaded with over 20 passengers and the paddler complained about it and pleaded with some of them to reduce their number to enable him to paddle across and come back but the complaint fell on deaf ears of the passengers who were eager to cross the river because it was getting dark. He said, “The paddler out of anger abandoned the canoe, then one of the passengers started paddling it across the river, suddenly the canoe capsised in the middle of the river in which seven of them were discovered missing while others came out alive.” He said as of yesterday Monday, three dead bodies out of the seven were recovered while four were still missing. The overseer of Lafia East Development Area, Mr. Shuiabu Dahiru Zanwa, who confirmed the incident to our correspondent, said efforts were on top gear to recover the remaining four bodies.
