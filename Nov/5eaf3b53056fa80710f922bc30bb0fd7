Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri Governor Emeka Ihedioha of Imo State has again claimed that he inherited a state that was in ruins from his predecessor, Rochas Okorocha. Ihedioha who spoke to journalists at his private residence in Owerri, the state capital, on Sunday, said the state he inherited was “epileptic.” He said despite the huge challenges he met on assumption of office, his administration had continued to “rebuild the state.” The governor said on assumption of office, he met institutional and infrastructural decay in the state. Ihedioha said he had “awarded 25 road contracts for over N40bn” since he became governor. The governor said he had been operating from his private residence since he became governor because his predecessor left the Government House in ruins. Ihedioha said, “I inherited an epileptic government. What I saw on assumption of office was worse than what I imagined when we were campaigning. “The Chief Judge of the state has no official quarters. The Speaker of the House of Assembly has no official quarters. I am operating from my official residence. I charge you to go and see things for yourselves. “We inherited a state with huge infrastructural and institutional decay, but we have restored confidence in the governance of our state. We have awarded 25 road contracts in five months of our administration. Imo people now have a governor they can be proud of.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
