Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja The All Progressives Congress has mourned Prof Tam David-West who served as Minister of Petroleum and Energy, and Minister of Mines, Power, and Steel at different times. With his death, the ruling party said Nigeria had lost a progressive voice and social critic who spoke truth to power. The APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement on Monday described him as an erudite scholar, who always held our leaders to account on issues of good governance. The statement said, “We recall his strong advocacy for oil sector reforms, particularly the passage of a mutually-beneficial Petroleum Industry Bill, fixing moribund refineries and ending the fuel subsidy racket that was a drainpipe on the country’s resources before the advent of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. “While the death of the late patriot is painful and a sad loss, we take solace with the fact that he lived an accomplished and impactful life. In death, we remember and celebrate a man who served the country diligently and championed the cause of the poor and underprivileged. “The party condoles with the late Tam David-West family members, friends, colleagues, the people and government of Rivers State. We pray the Almighty God gives them the strength to bear the loss.”
