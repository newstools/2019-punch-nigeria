Matthew Ochei, Asaba The Delta State Chief Judge, Justice Marshal Umukoro, has said kidnap suspects in the state custody would not be eligible for bail. Umukoro stated this on Wednesday, when he paid a working visit to Sapele Correctional Centre, in Sapele Local Government Area. He said, “Let me state it clearly, kidnap cases are no go areas as far as I am concerned. “What will people say about me if they hear that the CJ has released suspects held for alleged kidnap on bail? “What that will mean is that I am insensitive to the feelings of society,” The CJ, who was responding to numerous pleas for mercy by kidnap suspects awaiting trial, described kidnapping as a serious problem in society. The CJ was later presented with the case files of a total of 283 awaiting trial inmates, out of which he ordered the freedom of 23. The state Deputy Controller of Corrections, Mr. Ahmed Elekhine, who commended the state government for its assistance to the Sapele Correctional Centre, listed the provision of buses and the refurbishment of the old mini-Green Maria bus as laudable gestures of the Governor Ifeanyi Okowa-led administration.
