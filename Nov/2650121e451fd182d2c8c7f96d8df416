Success Nwogu, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party on Saturday urged President Muhammadu Buhari to address the issues of violence, killings and alteration of election results allegedly by the All Progressives Congress under his watch. The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan also said Buhari can not have a third term. He stated that if Buhari sought to uphold the constitution, he should have used the APC National Executive Committee meeting to directly and strongly condemn his party’s alleged resort to violence, killing, forceful invasion of polling units and alteration of results to seize votes in the November 16 Kogi and Bayelsa States governorship elections as well as the Kogi West Senatorial election.
