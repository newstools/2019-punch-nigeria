Peter Dada, Akure An unidentified man was killed in an auto crash, which occurred on the Ondo-Akure Expressway in Aponmu village, Akure South Local Government Area of Ondo State, on Monday. Several people were also injured in the crash, which involved a Toyota Picnic bus with number plate REL 815 XA, and a DAF 2800 trailer with number plate XA 705 DKU. The identity of the deceased had not been ascertained as of the time of filing this report. According to an eyewitness, the Toyota bus was heading for Okitipupa from Akure with a full load of passengers when it skidded off its lane and collided with the truck, which was travelling in the opposite direction. “It was a case of head-on collision between the bus and the truck. But it was the bus that collided with the truck on the other lane,” the eyewitness said. It was gathered that the accident caused gridlock on the road for several hours. The road was, however, cleared by the personnel of the state sector command of the Federal Road Safety Corps. Confirming the accident, the Head of Operations of the FRSC in the state, Mr Segun Ogungbemide, said the victims had been taken to the Ondo State Specialists’ Hospital, Akure. “The accident was caused by excessive speeding and loss of concentration on the part of the drivers of the vehicles. Eight people were involved in the crash; one died and seven were injured,” he stated. The FRSC officer warned motorists to avoid excessive speeding, overloading and other acts that violate traffic rules and regulations, particularly during the ‘ember’ months’. Copyright PUNCH.
