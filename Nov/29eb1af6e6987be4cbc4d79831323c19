Ademola Babalola, Ibadan The Academic Staff Union of Universities of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso campus, has issued a 10-day ultimatum, which will lapse on November 15 to the university management to pay their August, September and October salaries or face industrial crisis. The union said it might resort to strike action at the expiration of the ultimatum if the university failed to pay. Academic staff of the university are being owed 11 months cumulatively. Their latest position to down tools was contained in a congress resolution jointly signed by the chairman, Dr Biodun Olaniran and secretary, Dr Toyin Abegunrin. The union also threatened to withhold the ‘rain semester’ results of 2018/2019 academic session until the salaries are paid. ASUU maintained that the welfare of its members remained paramount and would do everything at her disposal not to expose her members to undeserved economic hardship. “The union gives the university administration till Friday, November 15, 2019, to pay the salaries of August, September and October 2019, failure of which will cause the union to hold a congress on Monday, November 18, 2019, where necessary action deemed fit will be taken,” ASUU stated.
