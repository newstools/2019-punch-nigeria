Ade Adesomoju, Abuna The High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in Gwagwalada, Abuja, on Thursday granted another bail to the then Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, and his former Secretary, Mrs Ann Olachi. Justice Abubakar Kutigi granted Maina bail in the sum of N100m, and Olachi in the sum of N10m. He ordered the defendants to produce two sureties, who must be responsible citizens and resident within the FCT. Earlier in the week, Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court in Abuja had granted bail to Maina in the sum of N1bn. He is being prosecuted before Justice Abang on corruption charges. The FCT High Courtâ€™s ruling granting bail to Maina on Thursday was in respect of a case in which Maina and Olachi were accused of dishonestly receiving stolen money, estimated at N738m. They are being prosecuted before both courts by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Copyright PUNCH.
