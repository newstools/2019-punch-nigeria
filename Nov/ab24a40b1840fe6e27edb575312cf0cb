The Peoples Democratic Party on Friday said the genuflections of Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State and Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu of Edo State to Kogi State electorate on Friday on behalf of Governor Yahaya Bello have come too late. In a statement on its verified Twitter handle, the PDP said that the pleas of the El-Rufai and Shaibu are “also a direct confirmation that the failed Governor Bello cannot lay claim to any genuine vote at the November 16 governorship election.” PDP said it noted that “The Edo State deputy governor, Philip Shuaibu, also knelt before the Kogi people to beg for Yahaya Bello which further shows that it is public knowledge that the governor misused the opportunity given to him to lead the state. “Unfortunately, the apology is coming too late in the day and cannot be accepted by the people of Kogi State, whose lives, Yahaya Bello had turned into a living hell in the last four year. Moreover, Yahaya Bello openly confirmed that he is irredeemable as he stood without any sign of remorse while El-Rufai and the Edo State deputy governor begged the unimpressed scanty crowd.
