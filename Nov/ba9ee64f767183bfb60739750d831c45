Maureen  Ihua-Maduenyi Air Peace and Brazilian aerospace conglomerate, Embraer, have signed a contract for three additional E195-E2 confirming purchase rights from the original contract, signed in April this year. With the new signing at the Dubai Airshow, Air Peace has made a total firm order of 13 E195-E2s with 17 purchase rights for the same model, whose delivery would begin in May 2020. The airline said on Sunday that the new E195-E2s with a value of $212.6m, based on Embraer’s current list prices, would be included in Embraer’s 2019 fourth-quarter backlog. Air Peace said the new aircraft would have dual configurations with 12-seater business class and 102-seater economy class. “The aircraft also comes in single configuration of all economy class of 144 seats,” the airline said in the statement. Air Peace Chief of Finance and Administration, Mrs Ejiroghene Eghagha, who signed the new deal on behalf of the airline, was quoted as saying the E195-E2 was the perfect aircraft to expand the carrier’s domestic and regional operations. She said, “The new deliveries will ease our subsidiary fleet in the Air Peace Hopper to actualise our ‘no-city-left-behind initiative which we shall continue to execute. “We are receiving impressive data about the aircraft’s economics when in revenue service, and this was a driver to place this new firm order with Embraer. We look forward to receiving our first aircraft, which will enhance connectivity in Nigeria and the African region.” She said the new order would gradually replace the airline’s existing fleet, which would make it the airline with the youngest fleet in the world.
