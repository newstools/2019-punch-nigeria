Gibson Achonu, Owerri Traditional rulers in Imo State, on Tuesday, appealed to the federal and state government to put an end to the incessant abduction of judicial officers in the country. They warned that the unhealthy development, if left unchecked, would spell doom for nation’s judicial system. The monarchs’ appeal is coming on the heels of the abduction of Justice Chioma Nwosu-Iheme of the Appeal Court, Benin City, Edo State, along the Benin-Agbor Road last month. Speaking in Owerri, the traditional ruler of the Nkwerre Kingdom, Eze Chijioke Okwara, who made the appeal on behalf of his community, where Justice Nwosu hails from, expressed regrets that after killing her police orderly, the kidnappers were still holding the judge. Okwara, who is the Eshi of Nkwerre, lamented that Justice Nwosu’s abductors had refused to establish contact with her family, the Imo State Government or the judiciary. He said, “It is highly regrettable that the very people, who these judicial officers are meant to serve, now turn around to harass and kidnap them. “We appeal to the Federal Government and the 36 states to come together and find lasting solutions to the nagging issue of violent kidnapping of innocent citizens of the land. “We will like to see a nation with a solid security network for the protection of lives and properties. This will enable judicial officers to discharge their duties without fear of molestation.” While urging the nation’s security agencies to do the needful to effect the release of the judge, Okwara said the monarchs would continue to make the necessary contact for the abducted judge to regain her freedom.
