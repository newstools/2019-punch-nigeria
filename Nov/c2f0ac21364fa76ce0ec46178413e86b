Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt The Ijaw Youth Council has denied claims in some quarters that it is supporting one of the governorship candidates in today’s (Saturday) governorship election in Bayelsa State. IYC President, Mr Eric Omare, described the claim as incorrect, adding that the council was not supporting any of the governorship candidates since they are all from Ijaw extraction. Omare, who spoke with our correspondent on Friday, called on the electorate in Bayelsa State to vote for the candidates of their choice. He also cautioned the people, especially the youth, against being used as political thugs during the exercise. He said, “We are not endorsing any candidate because all the candidates involved are Ijaw people. “Our advice is that Bayelsa people should go out and vote for the candidates of their choice and not to allow themselves to be used as political thugs, especially the youth.” Copyright PUNCH.
