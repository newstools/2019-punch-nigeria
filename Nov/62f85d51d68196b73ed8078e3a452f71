American singer-song writer Taylor Swift has won the Artist of the Year award at the 2019 American Music Awards held at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday in Los Angeles, California. She also won four other awards, in addition to the honorary Artist of the Decade Award — totaling six awards in one fell swoop. With 23 awards in the kitty prior, her one-night win of six awards gave her an all-time high of 29 AMAs, organisers said. This shattered the late Michael Jackson’s 24 awards. Taylor achieved this feat within 15 years of active professionalism, having been active since 2004. Thanking her fans and supporters, 29-year-old Swift said, “All that matters to me is the memories that I have had with you guys, with you the fans, over the years.” See the full list of nominees and subsequent winners: Artist of the Year
