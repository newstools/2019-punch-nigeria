Matthew Ochei, Asaba The Delta State Police Command has said that it has arrested the leader of a gang of kidnappers terrorising in the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyaye, who stated this on Wednesday in Asaba, said the leader of the gang that kidnapped a couple in Agbor was arrested while he was trying to collect ransom from the victims’ relations. “The couple was released without a ransom because the leader of the gang was arrested. The suspect has been transfer to the Criminal Investigation Department and investigation is ongoing,” Onovwakpoyaye said. She added that the command was intensifying efforts towards arresting other members of the gang. Southern City News gathered that a vigilante group in Agbor, Ika South Local Government Area of the state, had mobilised to rescue the couple after spending four days in the kidnappers’ den. It was learnt that the victims were kidnapped on Thursday last week by the five-man gang while driving out from their home at the Delta State Property Development Authority estate, Agbor. The kidnappers were said to have demanded N10m as ransom before the arrest of one of them by the vigilante group and the suspect led members of the group to the kidnappers’ den at Alifekede community, where the victims were rescued on Monday. The head of the vigilante group, Mr Monday Kiyem, said the group had since deployed its members for information gathering that eventually paid off. “Other members of the gang escaped before we reinforced to their hideout, but we arrested one person and handed him over to the police and he is now helping the security agents with vital information,” he added.
