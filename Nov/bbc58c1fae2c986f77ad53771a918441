Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe A professor of building and structural engineering, Patrick Nwankwo, on Thursday, told a Lagos State High Court in Igbosere that the collapsed Synagogue Church of All Nationsâ€™ guesthouse complied with the British standard code of building, adding that the collapse had nothing to do with structural defects. The Lagos State Government had sued SCOAN over the collapsed building that killed 116 persons on September 12, 2014. Two engineers, Oladele Ogundeji and Akinbela Fatiregun, and their companies, Hardrock Construction and Engineering Company and Jandy Trust Limited, were charged with 110 counts bordering on involuntary manslaughter, while the registered trustees of SCOAN were charged with one count of building without approval.
