Leke Baiyewu, Abuja No fewer than 10 people  have been killed in cult clashes in Igbokoda,Ondo State, according  to  the representative of  the llaje/Ese-Odo Federal Constituency in the House of representatives Kolade Akinjo. Akinjo at plenary on Tuesday called  on the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu; and the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral  Ibok-Ete Ibas, help restore calm in the area by   deploying more men  to prevent further loss of life. While adopting the motion, the House “urge the Inspector-General of Police and the Chief of Naval Staff to urgently mobilise more security personnel to Igbokoda and the neighbouring communities in a bid to arrest and investigate the  perpetrators of the ongoing ‘cult disturbance’ in the area”. The lawmakers also urged the IG to establish more police  divisions in the constituency, especially due to its littoral nature. Akinjo had earlier  moved a motion titled ‘Call for the Deployment of More Security Officials  to Ilajeland in Ilaje/Ese Odo Federal Constituency.’ He  said, “Igbokoda, the headquarters of llaje Local Government Area, despite its size and population, has been a difficult terrain in recent time due to a spate of cult violence in the community. “The clashes have created tension in the area, especially with the inflicting of injuries on innocent persons in the process. “The situation has degenerated into the point that our streets have turned into a war zone, thereby causing the residents and business owners in lgbokoda community sleepless nights due to fear of being attacked.” Copyright PUNCH.
