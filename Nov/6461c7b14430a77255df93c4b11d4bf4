Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa A former Niger Delta militant leader, Mr Eris Paul, has advised the Bayelsa State governor-elect, David Lyon, not to consider ex-agitators for political appointments. In a statement in Yenagoa on Wednesday, Paul said the state was in need of selfless persons who would make the suffering and burden of the people light without expecting anything in return. He said ex-militants should rather seek ways of partnering with the governor-elect to move the state forward on the path of peace, security and development. Paul said, “Instead of joining the bandwagon of political appointment-seekers in the state, they (the ex-militants) should support the governor-elect on an all-inclusive project; monitoring committees for quality infrastructure and acceptable standards of projects to compete with other cities in the developed world. “The shame I cannot share in, is the backwardness of our state in terms of development. If they are not careful about their feelings or the hustles for self-lifting political appointments, they may lose their respect from the people.” Copyright PUNCH.
