The National Chairman, All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has pleaded with all APC governors to implement the N30,000 minimum wage and the consequential adjustments. Oshiomhole made the plea on Monday in Jos at the Federal Government-Progressives Governors Forum parley in Jos. “As progressives, let us be the first to pay the new national minimum wage and not just the wage but also the consequential adjustments arising from it. “Already, there are some proactive progressive governors that have taken steps to address this.

The APC national chairman also called on the APC governors to support border closure by the Federal Government. He said that the nation’s borders should remain closed until neighbouring countries follow the protocols of fair trade. Oshiomole in an interview with journalists also lent his support to financial autonomy for Local Government Areas in the country. He said that LG autonomy was not negotiable. According to him, just as the Federal Government does not determine how state governors manage their money, so should the state governors allow the local governments to enjoy the same freedom. He said,  “Local governments should be autonomous, but autonomy doesn’t mean there should not be an oversight. “The same way the Federal Government goes after a state governor that breaks the financial rule, the same way state governor should go after local government that mismanages revenue that accrues to it,” he said.
