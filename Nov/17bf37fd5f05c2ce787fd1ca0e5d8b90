Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State has attributed his two terms in office to the intervention of God, lamenting that “it is a difficult task to govern Bayelsa State.” The governor stated this on Wednesday while playing host to the 1992 set of Rivers State University of Science and Technology Law Students at the Government House, Yenagoa, according to a statement on Thursday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Fidelis Soriwei. Dickson told his classmates that the more progress and achievements he made, the more people tried to blackmail him, adding that he had done his best for his people. He said he was sure of occupying a prominent place when “an unbiased history” of the development of Bayelsa State would be written. The governor, who expressed gratitude to his friends and acquaintances from his alma mater, told them that God was not through with him yet as he never imagined he would become the governor of Bayelsa State. “I thank you for your abiding solidarity. This is not the first time individually and collectively you have been here to encourage and support me in all these periods that I have remained here as governor yet, and in some sense as a glorified prisoner,” Dickson said. He reiterated his stance that the integrity and legitimacy of the just-concluded governorship election was allegedly compromised by the Independent National Electoral Commission with the support of security forces to favour the All Progressives Congress.
