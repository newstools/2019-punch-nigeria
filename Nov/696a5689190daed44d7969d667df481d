Former President Goodluck Jonathan has expressed disappointment at the handling of the voting process in his ward. He expressed dissatisfaction over the lateness of the arrival of voting materials at the polling unit. Jonathan spoke to journalists after he and his wife, Patience, had voted at Unit 39, Ward 13 at the Otazi Playground, Otuoke, in Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. News Agency of Nigeria reports that Jonathan voted at 11.30 a.m., while his wife voted at 11.35 a.m. Ward 13 is made up of five communities of Otuoke, Otuaba, Ewoi, Otuabula 1 and Otuabula 2. He said: “We must conduct ourselves if we want to bring real people to rule us, either as president or governors. “Nigerians are always blaming people in authorities and the leaders; so, here, they must blame themselves. “Look at even this voting. I was around earlier, but the materials had yet to arrive in the polling unit. “I have led election monitoring teams to other African countries, we used to go 30 minutes before the time and in our reports, we indicated the exact time the votes started. “So, for election to start after that time, it is an indictment to the electoral body that manages election. There is no reason why election should not start by 8:00 a.m. “So, even the youth should stop blaming old people, you blame yourselves and do things properly. “I am really disappointed with what I observed today, compared to other African countries where I had monitored elections.’’  (NAN)
