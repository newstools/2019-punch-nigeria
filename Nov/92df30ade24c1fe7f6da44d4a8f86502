Olaleye Aluko, Abuja The Defence Headquarters, Abuja, on Tuesday described as a serious issue an allegation that Turkey was supporting the Boko Haram insurgents. The acting Director, Defence Information, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, stated this in a Whatsapp message to our correspondent in Abuja. There was a report on Tuesday that the CBN News Channel recently reported that Turkey was a major supplier of arms to Boko Haram. Reacting to an inquiry  by the correspondent, Nwachukwu said, “The “temporary border closure and other strategic measures” were going on to tackle the illicit inflow of weapons into the country. He said, “Though the veracity of the claims in the video footage that Turkey is supporting Boko Haram terrorists with weapons cannot be ascertained immediately. It is however a serious national security issue and  I believe it is receiving the required attention at the national strategic level. “The temporary closure of our national borders is one of the indications of the national strategic move to checkmate illicit trans border shipment and peddling of fire arms. “It is expedient however that conspiracy theories surrounding the supply and acquisition of arms by terrorist groups be accorded the deserved global attention to meaningfully tackle networks of terrorism and their sponsors.” A source at the  Turkish embassy said the mission was waiting for a reaction to the allegation from its home country.
