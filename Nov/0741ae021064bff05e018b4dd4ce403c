Peter Dada, Akure The Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has disclosed that the Ondo and Ekiti State governments have concluded plans to construct a tollgate on a federal road, Akure-Ado-Ekiti Expressway. According to the governor, the tollgate will be constructed after the road, which was designed to be a dual carriage way, was completed. The Akure-Ado Ekiti road has been in a poor condition. Motorists and commuters have been calling on the government to repair or reconstruct the road. Akeredolu, who spoke on Sunday, at a special thanksgiving service held at the Christ Apostolic Church, Mount of Monument of God’s Grace, Otapete Owo, said the project would be financed with a loan from the African Development Bank. He, however, said  the move was awaiting the approval of the Federal Executive Council. The governor said, “When completed, this road will be tolled so as to enable the state government to have a channel of repaying money that will be spent on it. “Akure to Ado road, we have written a letter to the Federal Government and we are sure that the President will sign it and it will be taken to the Federal Executive Council. “We are only waiting for the approval of FEC. The African Development Bank is ready to give us loan to dualise the road and it will be tolled.” Addressing the congregation at the service, Akeredolu urged Christians to be conscious of the kingdom of God.
