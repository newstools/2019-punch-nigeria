The LASTMA General Manager further revealed that it is unfortunate that the agency lost the young promising officer in the early hours of Saturday, November 30, 2019. “He has therefore assured that the perpetrators of the dastardly act that were caught will be prosecuted to serve as a deterrent to other members of the public who may harbour committing such crime in future.” Oduyoye stated that with the recent inauguration of a committee on war against traffic and environmental offenders, there would be no hiding place for Lagos residents or visitors who violate the law.
