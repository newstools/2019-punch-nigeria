A policewoman, Inspector Emem Okon, on Friday told an Ikeja Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court that a school proprietor, Timothy Onyiriuka, 45, allegedly defiled a 14-year-old pupil with special needs in his care. The Onyiriuka, 45, who lives on Idowu Bale Street, Ajah, Lagos, is charged with defilement contrary to Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2011. He is the proprietor of Apex Schools on Edomia Street, Power Line, Oke-Ira, Kekere, Ajah, Lagos, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. Okon, the Investigating Police Officer in the case while being led in evidence by the prosecutor Mrs Arinola Momoh-Ayokanbi, informed the court that the mother of the minor, who has speech impairment, came to the Langbasa Police Station to report the school proprietor. “On October 21, 2013, the mother of the victim came to the police station in distress. She said her daughter was defiled by her school proprietor Mr Timothy Onyiriuka. My superior asked me to take her to one of the offices and report back to him. I reported back to him that the minor was defiled,” she said. The policewoman said shortly after the incident, she was sent to Kwara to undergo a course and that a subordinate took over the case. While being cross-examined by the defence counsel, Mr A.C. Abarah, the policewoman revealed that she wrote the two statements on behalf of the mother and the complainant because they could not write. NAN reports that the school proprietor, who has been remanded in prison, allegedly defiled the pupil within the school premises. Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos 2011 prescribes life imprisonment for anyone found guilty of defilement of a child. Justice Abiola Soladoye adjourned the case until January 15, 2020.
