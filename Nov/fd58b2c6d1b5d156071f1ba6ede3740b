Alexander Okere The President of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria, Dame Gladys Simplice, has described tax education as an important measure towards boosting revenue in Nigeria. Simplice, who is also the chairman of council of the institute, said there was a compelling need to reinvigorate enlightenment mechanisms, if the federal and state governments’ desired to bring in more taxable Nigerians to tax net to and broaden the much-needed government revenue to address infrastructural deficit. She, therefore, called on government agencies, particularly the National Orientation Agency, to rise up to the challenge to change the narrative of poor tax awareness in the country. Speaking during the 41st induction of 586 members as tax professionals, the CITN president said, “It is no longer news that taxation has assumed the front burner in recent national discourse. Government and the governed are accustomed to living off revenue from oil and other mineral exports. “Today, with glaring challenges of development and low revenue receipts from oil and its associated sources, we now see the need to look inwards. Therefore, taxation has become a subject of interest in all facets of our national life. “More than ever before, there is a compelling need to reinvigorate our enlightenment and education mechanisms. The National Orientation Agency must wake up to its statutory responsibilities.” Simplice further recommended that taxes should be few in number, broad-based and high revenue-yielding. Also speaking, the special guest of honour, Udochukwu Ogbonna, advised the inductees to uphold integrity as one of the tenets of the profession and exhibit diligence and honesty as tax professionals.
