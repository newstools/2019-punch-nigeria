Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo A visually impaired man, Kareem Adebayo, 77, was on Wednesday arraigned before an Osun State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Osogbo for allegedly being in possession of substances suspected to be Indian hemp. Adebayo appeared before Magistrate Risikat Olayemi on two counts bordering on possession of Indian hemp. The accused, it was learnt, was caught on November 5, 2019, around 6.30pm at the Odofin compound, Okuku, with a bag containing large quantity of dried leaves suspected to be Indian hemp. He was also alleged to have conducted himself in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace. The offences were said to be contrary to and punishable under sections 430 and 249 (d) of the Criminal Code, Cap 38c Vol. 11, Laws of Osun State of Nigeria, 2003. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges. The police prosecutor, Rachael Idowu, explained that Adebayo had been arrested twice in the past by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, faced trial and spent several months in jail. Upon regaining his freedom, Idowu said Adebayo returned to dealing in illicit drugs. The accused did not have legal representation when he was arraigned. Olayemi, in her ruling, transferred the case to the Okuku Magistrates’ Court for mention on November 11, 2019, because the offences were committed within the Okuku Magisterial District. She also said the police should grant the accused bail because of his age and health condition pending his arraignment on November 11. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
