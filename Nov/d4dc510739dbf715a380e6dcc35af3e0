An Ado-Ekiti Magistrates’ Court on Friday ordered that a 30-year-old woman, Idowu Akomolafe, who allegedly slashed a woman’s face with razor blade, be remanded in a correctional facility. The Police charged Akomolafe, whose address was not provided, with attempted murder. The Magistrate, Mrs. Kehinde Awosika, who did not take the plea of Akomolafe, ordered the Police to return the case file to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Awosika adjourned the case until January 16, for mention. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Samson Osubu, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on November 2, in Ado-Ekiti. He alleged that the defendant attempted to kill a 42-year-old woman, Denike Olugboye. Osubu said the defendant used a razor blade and slashed Olugboye on her body, when she publicly accused her of having an extra-martial affair with her husband. He said the victim is on admission in the hospital. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of Section 320 of the Criminal Code, Law of Ekiti State, 2012. (NAN)
