Samson Folarin The Lagos State Government has said night clubs and bars sealed over noise pollution will no longer be reopened without a clearance letter from the residents’ association of the area where they do business. Also affected are churches and mosques said to have violated the state law on noise pollution. The Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, said the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency had been mandated to apply the full weight of the law in the matter. Bello, according to a statement on Tuesday, said LASEPA officials would go on surveillance visits regularly and any centre found to have exceeded the allowed level of sound output would be shut down and sanctions applied. He noted that the government observed that many of the leisure and religious centres reopened after being sealed usually returned to the same noise pollution for which they were earlier axed. The commissioner added that the discovery prompted the involvement of residents’ associations. “Bello said the action became imperative because his office had been inundated with complaints and petitions from many residents and residents’ associations about the obnoxious noise levels of many leisure centres and religious homes. “He advised the affected leisure centres to procure soundproof equipment which would lessen the decibel of sound that goes out when they are in business. “The commissioner emphasised that the state government would not allow any business concern to put the wellbeing of residents at peril simply because it wants to operate,” the statement stated.
