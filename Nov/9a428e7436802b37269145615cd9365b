Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad, on Tuesday advised 5,689 lawyers newly called to the bar to be steadfast and preserve the honour and dignity of the legal profession. The new wigs are the successful candidates who passed the August 2019 Bar final examinations. At the call-to-bar ceremony held at the Nigerian Law School, Bwari, Abuja, the CJN called on the new lawyers to display the highest level of professional ethics and decorum. He said, “You must be steadfast and preserve the honour and dignity of the profession.” The CJN also urged them to leave good footprints on the sands of time. He urged them to be courageous and bold enough to break new grounds and seek advice from experienced senior counsel.
