James Abraham, Jos The Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, on Tuesday, presented a budget of N172bn to the state House of Assembly for the 2020 fiscal year. The budget, christened ‘Budget of rescue and infrastructural consolidation’, put the capital expenditure at N74bn while the recurrent expenditure amounted to N98bn. Lalong said the rationale behind the budget was to emphasise his administration’s commitment and resilience to the ideals of continuity in governance, policy and programme implementation, as well as sustainability in socio-economic prosperity and infrastructural development of the state. He said, “This budget was prepared under a reasonable degree of consistency both in policy and realism since we came into office in 2015. We shall also consolidate the gains and achievements of this administration’s first term in office.” Lalong urged the lawmakers to pass the budget without delay to enable him to continue the “good works.” The Speaker of the state Assembly, Mr Ayuba Izam, expressed hope that the budget would bring economic development and prosperity to the people of the state.
