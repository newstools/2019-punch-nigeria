Tony Okafor, Awka A 65-year-old medical doctor in Anambra State, Gilbert Gini, was on Wednesday found dead in a room in his clinic. According to a source, the body was found already decomposing. The late doctor, it was gathered, occupied two flats, which served as his clinic on No. 9 Eze Crescent, Ezinifite Okpuno, near Awka, the state capital. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Haruna Mohammed, confirmed the incident to our correspondent. He said one Duke Ezeonwuka, a lawyer, discovered the body when he visited the property that the late doctor occupied. The PPRO said Ezeonwuka, who is the manager of the property, found it locked and perceived a strong stench oozing out of it. Mohammed said, “Ezeonwuka was taken aback by the unusual odour oozing out from one of the rooms on the upper floor, which prompted him to call on neighbours, who assisted to open the window and they saw the decomposing body in the room. The PPRO added, “Police detectives from the ‘B’ Division, Awka, led by the DPO, visited the scene and confirmed the incident. “The victim’s Gionee mobile phone, which was plugged for charging, was recovered. Photographs were taken at the scene. “No instrument of violence was seen or observed, and no foul play is suspected from a critical analysis of the crime scene. “The relatives have been contacted and arrangements are ongoing to evacuate the remains for autopsy and prevent an outbreak of disease in the vicinity.” Mohammed added that Ezeonwuka told detectives that the deceased regularly travelled to Brazil, resulting in him shutting down the clinic often, and that he was presumed to have travelled in September.
