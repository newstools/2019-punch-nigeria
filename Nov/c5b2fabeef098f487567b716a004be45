The Republic of Turkey has confirmed the arrest of slain terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s older sister, Rasmiya Awad. Making the news known via his verified Twitter handle @fahrettinaltun, Turkey’s Director of Communication, Fahrettin Altun, states that:  Since the reported assassination of the ISIS leader, Turkish authorities said it had also located and detained a relative of the former terrorist number one. Altun also used the announcement to scold those who question Turkey’s resolve in fighting ISIS, calling it “dark propaganda.” “We have been leading in the fight against terrorism in all its forms. Our strong counter-terrorism cooperation with like-minded partners can never be questioned,” Altun stated in a series of tweets. They were captured in Azaz district of Aleppo city in northwestern Syria on Monday, the Turkish interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, said on Tuesday. Turkey’s “determination to bring justice to those who seek to terrorise our people and destabilise our region cannot be questioned,” he added. The woman, 65-year-old Rasmiya Awad, is said to be the older sister of the notorious former ISIS leader. She is suspected of being affiliated with the terrorist organisation and thus capable of providing information about its structure and members. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based watchdog, Awad’s daughter-in-law and five grandchildren were also arrested by Turkey. President Donald Trump had announced on October 27 that American forces had raided al-Baghdadi’s hideout in Syria’s Idlib province and that the terrorist number one had killed himself using a suicide vest after being trapped in a dead-end tunnel. His body was mutilated by the blast, but Trump said he had been identified by his DNA. Like Osama bin Laden, al-Baghdadi’s body was also buried at sea, while his hideout was destroyed in an airstrike. ISIS has since confirmed the death of its leader, and a new leader appointed.
