Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja Eight persons were confirmed dead in Felele on the Lokoja-Abuja Expressway, Lokoja, on Monday, in an accident involving a petrol tanker and other vehicles. Many vehicles, including tricycles, were also burnt as a result of the fire that followed the crash, while many people sustained varying degrees of injury. Our correspondent, who visited the scene, gathered that the driver of the petrol-laden truck lost control around the NNPC filling station as the vehicle suffered a brake failure. Eyewitnesses stated that the tanker rammed into four tricycles, two motorcycles, three cars and a bus, spilled its content on them and the ensuing fire consumed them. However, men of the state fire service rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. Most of the filling stations in the area were closed, while men of the fire service were strategically positioned to prevent the spread of the fire. Officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps were also on the ground to evacuate the corpses of the deceased, while those who were injured were rushed to hospitals. According to the FRSC, the crash occurred around 8.50am at the Felele area along the Lokoja-Abuja Expressway as a result of brake failure on the part of a white DAF petrol-laden tanker with number plate JEG 141 XA. Seventeen persons were said to be involved in the accident, out of which eight were killed, while seven were injured. The victims were taken to the Federal Medical Centre and the Specialist Hospital, Lokoja, by the FRSC. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
