Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Deputy Governor of Imo State, Gerald Irona, has said that the state government has zero tolerance for criminality. Irona, who spoke while receiving over 1,000 stakeholders from the Assa and Obile autonomous communities in the Ohaji/Egbema Local Government Area of the state, who came on a solidarity visit to the Government House, charged community leaders to assist the government and security agencies in fighting crime. He said the Governor Emeka Ihedioha administration in the state was taking steps to returning the government to the people. Irona said every community must remain law-abiding. Earlier in his speech, the President General, Assa Autonomous Community, Uyaeme Chinedu, said the leaders were at the Government House to express gratitude to Ihedioha for checking criminality in the area. He assured the government of their continued support. Also speaking, Festus Ogbonna of the Obile Autonomous Community distanced the two communities from a recent protest against the setting up of a caretaker committee, even as they passed a vote of confidence in the administration in the state. Ogbonna stated, “Our area has never had electricity, but in less than six months of the present administration, the Imo State Government, through the Imo State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission, has commenced the process of giving us electricity. “Before now, we were living in fear following the activities of bandits, but, today, the state government has arrested the situation and normalcy has been restored in our area.” Copyright PUNCH.
