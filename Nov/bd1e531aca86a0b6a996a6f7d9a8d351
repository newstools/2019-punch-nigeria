Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Government on Friday arraigned a Dangote driver, Serif Adebayo, before a Lagos State Special Offences Court for allegedly killing a driver and three passengers after crushing a Bus Rapid Transit in the Ikorodu area of Lagos. City Round had reported that the driver of the Dangote Cement-laden truck suffered a brake failure on August 27 and skidded into the BRT lane at the Ogolonto area of Ikorodu, crushing the bus with number plate LSR 228 XS and killing four people. About  69 others were injured in the crash. Adebayo was arraigned on four counts of involuntary manslaughter to which he pleaded not guilty. According to the state prosecutor, Yakubu Osoala, the offences contravened Section 224 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. Osoala told the court that Adebayo unlawfully killed four people while dangerously and recklessly driving his truck with the number plate KNC 178 XA. The deceased persons were the BRT driver, Samuel Akpochi, Adenike Ismail, Sunday Balogun and Augustine Isaac.
