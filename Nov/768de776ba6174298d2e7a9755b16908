Olaide Oyelude, Katsina Gunmen, on Thursday, abducted Hajiya Lubabatu, wife of the Katsina State Deputy Accountant General, Sani Barkin-Kasua. Insiders said Lubabatu, who returned from a lesser Hajj (Umrah) on Tuesday, was abducted on Wednesday night. It was learnt that the gunmen gained entry into the GRA residence of the deputy accountant general, using a Peugeot 206 car, which the private guards mistook for one of his cars. The sources added that after the gunmen had entered the compound, they manhandled those in the house and demanded Lubabatu. They ordered her into their car and sped off. Barkin-Kasua was reportedly not in when the gunmen stormed the house. Efforts to get his comments on the incident on Thursday were not successful as he could not be reached. Sympathisers, who were mainly top civil servants, were seen around the house. The abductors had yet to make contact with the family as of the time of filing this report. Spokesman for the Katsina State Police Command, Gambo Isah, could not be reached for comments; his telephone lines continued to ring out. Copyright PUNCH.
