Oladimeji Ramon The Federal High Court in Lagos has fixed December 5 to take arguments on whether or not two Ikoyi houses belonging to ex-Senate President, Bukola Saraki, should be permanently forfeited to the Federal Government. Justice Mohammed Liman had on October 21 ordered the temporary forfeiture of the houses, “lying and known as No. 17A McDonald Road, Ikoyi,” to the Federal Government. He adjourned till Thursday for anyone interested in the houses to appear before him to state why they should not be permanently forfeited to the Federal Government. At the resumed proceedings on Thursday, the EFCC lawyer, Abdullahi Idris, told the judge that the order was published in The Nation newspaper as directed by the judge. The judge fixed December 5 to hear from Saraki and any other interested party on why the properties should not be permanently forfeited. The EFCC had told the judge it reasonably suspected that the properties were acquired with proceeds of unlawful activities. It alleged in a supporting affidavit that Saraki, who served two terms as the Kwara State governor between 2003 and 2011, “withdrew over N12bn cash from the account of the Kwara State Government and paid same into his accounts domiciled in Access and Zenith Banks through one of his personal assistants, Abdul Adama, at different intervals.” Copyright PUNCH.
