Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt THE Acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Dr. Joi Nunieh, has said that the interventionist agency would drive a ‘Niger Delta Next Level Re-Orientation’ campaign to promote a non-violent and clean Niger Delta region. Nunieh stated this on Monday during a courtesy visit by a delegation from the Amayanabo of Okochiri, in Okrika Local Government Area of Rivers State, King Ateke Tom, at the NDDC headquarters in Port Harcourt. “We want all Niger Delta stakeholders to join hands in the re-orientation for a better environment and a non-violent Niger Delta.  With a clean and peaceful environment, investors will be interested to come to the region,” she said. She urged the people of Niger Delta to support the efforts of the Federal Government to clean up Nigeria’s oil-rich region, assuring them that NDDC will encourage the various communities to keep their villages and waterways clean. The NDDC boss called on all Niger Delta stakeholders to join in the new movement to take the region to the next level, assuring them that President Muhammadu Buhari was determined to give the NDDC a new face and a new lease of life. She noted: “The President stands with us in the quest to turn things around for good in the Niger Delta. That is why he approved the setting up of the Interim Management Committee to ensure that the process of the forensic auditing of the NDDC was carried out properly.” Nunieh stated that stakeholders in the region no longer had a need to visit the NDDC to get things done because according to her, our work would henceforth speak for us. Earlier in his remarks, the leader of the delegation from the Amayanabo of Okochiri, Mr. Opia Ojieh, said they came to identify with the Interim Management Committee of the NDDC. Ojieh regretted that the NDDC, which was set up to fast track the development of the Niger Delta region, had not lived up to the expectations of the people of the region.
