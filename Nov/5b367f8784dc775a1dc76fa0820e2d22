Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri The Appeal Court in Owerri on Saturday sacked the member representing Isiala Mbano/Onuimo/Okigwe federal constituency of Imo State in the House of representatives, Obinna Onwubuariri. The chairman of the panel, Justice R.N Pemu, who read the judgment said that the election that brought Onwubuariri of the Peoples Democratic Party to power in February was not in tandem with the Electoral Act, 2010, as amended. The appellant court said that the electoral tribunal was right to have ordered a fresh election in the federal constituency.

Pemu, therefore, ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to withdraw the Certificate of Return it had earlier issued Onwubuariri and conduct a fresh election in the entire federal constituency within 90 days. It could be recalled that the tribunal had sacked Onwubuariri, but the lawmaker dissatisfied with the judgment went to the appeal court.
