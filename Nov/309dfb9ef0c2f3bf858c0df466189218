Feyisayo Popoola Investors have oversubscribed to the Treasury Bills auctioned by the Central Bank of Nigeria to the tune of N383bn (or 254 per cent), despite a further crash in interest rates. The CBN recorded a total subscription of N533.93bn on the N150.6bn worth of treasury bills offered on Wednesday. Interest rates crashed further from 7.7998 per cent, nine per cent and 10 per cent recorded on the 91-day, 182-day and 364-day tenors, respectively, at the last auction, to 6.4950 per cent, 7.23 per cent and 8.37 per cent. On the 91-day tenor, a total of N24.37bn was offered while the CBN allocated N20.37bn. Another N19.16bn was allotted out of the total N107.63bn subscriptions recorded on the 182-day tenor while the CBN allotted N111.07bn from the N319.42bn subscriptions received on the 364-day tenor. An investor, Tunde Alao, said he feared that the treasury bills interest rates would soon be lower than saving account rates. He said with the Monetary Policy Rate (also known as the benchmark interest rate) unchanged and a continued increase of interest rates in the Open Market Operations, the story would become a tale of two markets.

He added that it would also close avenues for “rent-seeking” and obnoxious fees, noting that the banks would find ways to deploy their capital. Aja, however, urged investors not to invest because of returns but to match their investment objectives and risk profile available to asset classes.
