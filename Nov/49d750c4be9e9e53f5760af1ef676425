Ade Adesomoju, Abuja The Federal High Court in Abuja on Thursday adjourned ruling on the bail application by a former chairman of the defunct Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina. Justice Okon Abang said the date for the ruling would be fixed before the close of work on Thursday. But no date has been fixed for the ruling as of the time of filing this report on Thursday. Justice Abang noted that he had not been able to conclude writing the ruling due to the workload the court had to contend with. Maina, who appeared in court on Thursday on a wheelchair, had been remanded at Kuje Prison since October 25, 2019. Justice Abang had ordered his remand shortly after the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission arraigned him and a firm, Common Input Property and Investment Ltd, on 12 counts bordering on money laundering and fraud. Earlier on Tuesday, there was controversy over his health as he missed the court sitting during which the judge acknowledged a letter from prison authorities indicating that the defendant was not fit to attend court on health grounds. The EFCCâ€™s counsel, Mr Mohammed Abubakar, who had queried the truthfulness of the content of the letter, urged the court to compel the deputy comptroller of the Nigerian Correctional Service in charge of medical and welfare, to personally examine Maina and report on his health condition to the court. Ruling, the judge noted that the letter from prison was not helpful as it did not disclose when Maina would be able to resume his trial. The court then adjourned till November 21 and 22 for trial.
