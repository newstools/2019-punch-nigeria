#CongratulationsDoc is currently trending on Twitter as Nigerians “tap into the blessing” of one Dr. Harvey Olufunmilayo who tweeted photos of his newly acquired house in the United Kingdom. Olufunmilayo, who tweets via @DrOlufunmilayo had tweeted on Sunday:  Although @DrOlufunmilayo’s Twitter handle has no photograph, Olufunmilayo tweeted what is believed to be his own photograph in his new house, alongside a man who appears to share the moment with him. As his teeming followers congratulate him and tap into his blessing, someone expresses doubt about the possibility of the achievement between 2016 when he landed in the UK and now — a period spanning three years. One Usman @usmee queries: “Congratulations Doc. Please also explain to your followers how you worked hard. I’m sure a lot of them may think it’s pretty much easy to acquire such within that short period. Some doctors have been there for over 5 years & are still trying to make ends meet.” Olufunmilayo responds:
Thanks Usman.
