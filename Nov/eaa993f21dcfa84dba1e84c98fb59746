Tunde Oyekola The Presidency has lamented the poor attitude of many beneficiaries of its N-Power poverty alleviation programme. The Special adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Job Creation, Muhammed Brimah, spoke on Saturday in Ilorin at a programme organised by ‘The Companion’, an Islamic youth association. The programme centred on how to create employment for the teeming youths of Nigeria with the theme, ‘Unemployment and national insecurity, The Nexus and Panacea’. It had Dr Bashir Kurfi as the guest lecturer. The Federal Government had since 2016 engaged about 500,000 youths in educational and agricultural programmes to solve youth unemployment in the country. Speaking at the programme, Brimah said, “The initiative of N-Power was not to create permanent jobs of N30,000 monthly salaries for the beneficiaries but to train them on employability skills and how they can as well be independent and be employers of labour after they must have passed through two years training. “But it is just unfortunate that many of the beneficiaries are not taking it seriously with the report that most of them do not always report at their places of training; instead they prefer sharing the stipend with the head of those organisations.” Copyright PUNCH.
