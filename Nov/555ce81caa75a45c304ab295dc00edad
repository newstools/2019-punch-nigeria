The minster added that for Kano State, N4.5bn was approved for Sharada to Madobi and Dambori road. On the link road between Ekiti and Osun states, he said, “That road was awarded in 2009; the contractor had achieved about five per cent of the work; so, we are trying to complete that road. “It was slowed down in previous years due to insufficient budget. During that period, the price at which it was awarded and today’s material prices have altered significantly.” Copyright PUNCH.
