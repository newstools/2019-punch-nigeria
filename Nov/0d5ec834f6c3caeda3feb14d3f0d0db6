Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe The Lagos State Task Force on Environmental and Special Offences has vowed to go hard on all environmental and traffic law violators in the state. According to the Chairman of the agency, Olayinka Egbeyemi, the new Commissioner of Police in the state, Hakeem Odumosu, gave the directive to the agency, adding that it had become imperative as a way of sanitising the environment and ensuring the free flow of traffic in the state. He added that the agency had been directed to clear all illegal traders, abandoned vehicles, roadside mechanics, miscreants, motorcyclists and others constituting environmental nuisance in the state. Egbeyemi, who implored all illegal traders and roadside mechanics to vacate immediately, also urged owners of abandoned vehicles to remove them,  adding that anyone caught during the enforcement would be severely dealt with in accordance with the law. He noted that with the ongoing road rehabilitation projects across the state, there was an urgent need to create free flow of traffic for motorists by clearing all obstructions on the roads. “The directive is to be jointly carried out with the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps and the Lagos State Neighbourhood Safety Corps, and the areas to be covered during the enforcement operations include Igando, Ikorodu, Ajah, Mile 2, Obalende, Oyingbo, Dopemu, Iyana-Ipaja, Agege, Ojota, Idimu, Yaba, Ikate-Elegushi, Apple Junction (Festac), Bogije and Mushin,” he added. Egbeyemi urged members of the public to support the agency by providing useful security information on criminal activities around them to security agencies through the toll-free emergency lines 112 and 767.
