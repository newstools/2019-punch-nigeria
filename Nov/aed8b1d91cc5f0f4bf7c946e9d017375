Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja The Civil Resource Development and Documentation Centre on Sunday said it had concluded its survey on the level of budget transparency and fiscal discipline in states. The organisation said the outcome of the survey, which would be released on November 19, was targeted at ensuring an open, inclusive and accountable budget and procurement process. The group said in a statement that while the Federal Government had made progress in its war against corruption, Nigerians were still craving for a transparent budget and procurement process. According to the statement, the general goal of the survey is to instill transparency in budgeting and budget process across the 36 states of the federation by focusing on four key indicators. “The indicators are public availability of budget information, public participation in the budget process, public availability of procurement information and legal framework on access to budget information and fiscal responsibility,” it said. It said the survey, funded by the Department for International Development, would also evaluate the amount allocated to different types of spending, the revenues collected and how international donor assistance and other public resources were used. The statement said, “Budget transparency entails that all citizens of a state can access information on: how much is allocated to different types of spending, what revenues are collected, and how international donor assistance and other public resources are used. “Having access means they will be in a better position to participate in the hearings and contribute to how the country’s resources are used and to hold government accountable.” Copyright PUNCH.
