Sola Shittu, Benin The Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, on Thursday rejected the affirmation of the suspension of the state Chairman of the party, Mr Anselm Ojezua, by the National Working Committee. The state Assistant Secretary of the party, Mr Anthony Ikhuenobe, in a statement described the decision of the NWC on Wednesday as “biased, considering the speed with which it accepted the unconstitutional attempt by some misguided renegade members of the State Working Committee under the sponsorship and supervision of the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, to remove the state chairman from office without recourse to the State Executive Committee.” Ikhuenobe added, “In any case, the SEC of the party in Edo State had met on November 12, 2019 and passed a vote of implicit confidence in the Chairman, Anselm Ojezua. “Nothing was done to authenticate the signatories to the infamous document relied on by the officers concerned. Similarly, the Chief of Staff to Governor Godwin Obaseki, Mr Taiwo Akerele, said the resolution of the “hurriedly assembled NWC upholding a resolution of compromised APC members is very unfortunate.” Akerele said, “It is the National Executive Committee, comprising of state governors and other leaders, that has the power to uphold whatever a state has done. It is unfortunate that Oshiomhole has refused to live above board in the crisis engulfing Edo state.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
