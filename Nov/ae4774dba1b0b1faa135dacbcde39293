Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja The Kogi State Government has promised to compensate victims of the violence that greeted the November 16 governorship and Kogi West senatorial rerun elections. The Director General, Media Publicity and Strategy to the Governor, Kingsley Fanwo, who spoke to journalists after the state executive council meeting in Lokoja, stated that the council was shocked at the violence during the elections. Fanwo said, “The State Executive Council has condemned in strong terms, the pockets of violence which greeted the last governorship election in the state. Loss of lives in the struggle for power is mindless and unacceptable. “The council also commended security agencies for their efforts at bringing purveyors and promoters of such violence to book. “Of particular reference was the woman who was burnt in Ochadamu and the man who was stabbed to death. “As a government, we will give security agencies every support to arrest and prosecute those who hid under politics to perpetrate crime. “But beyond that, we will compensate families that lost loved ones and properties. We know nothing could pay for the life of a human being; but as a government, our hearts are with those bereaved families,” Fanwo added. Copyright PUNCH.
