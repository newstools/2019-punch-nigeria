Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta The governorship candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement in Ogun State, Adekunle Akinlade, has filed notice of appeal at the Supreme Court to challenge the victory of Governor Dapo Abiodun at the March 9, 2019 poll. Akinlade, in a statement by his media aide, Azeez Adelani, on Sunday, said the appeal had been filed on Saturday, November 23, 2019 to challenge the Ibadan Court of Appeal judgment of November 11. The candidate was quoted in the statement as saying, “My resolve to see this struggle to a logical conclusion hinged on the constitutionality of our actions and the need to truly represent the people who came out in their thousands on March 9, 2019 to vote for me.” The statement added, “To Akinlade, this is not about his personal ambition but a call to duty and honour. “It may help to note that each stage of this struggle, from the tribunal to the Court of Appeal, and now the Supreme Court, comes at a very high cost in terms of legal fees but no amount is too much to pay for justice. “Akinlade, therefore, thanks everyone who has contributed one way or the other to this struggle. No matter how this ends, we must remain resolute and determined because it is not the end for us but the beginning of greater heights.” CopyrightPUNCH.
