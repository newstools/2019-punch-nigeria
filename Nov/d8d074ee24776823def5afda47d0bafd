Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has begun investigation into the collapse of the Delta Steel Company built with $1.89bn. The lawmakers are also investigating why the 10 per cent of the mining proceeds had not been paid to the host community. At the plenary on Wednesday, a member of the House from Delta State, Ben Igbakpa, moved a motion titled, ‘Need to Investigate the Collapse of the Delta Steel Company,’ which the House unanimously adopted and mandated the committees on steel and works to carry out the probe. The committees were specifically asked to “conduct investigation of the sale and the subsequent failure of Premium Steel and Mines Limited to put the steel company into operations.” Copyright PUNCH.
