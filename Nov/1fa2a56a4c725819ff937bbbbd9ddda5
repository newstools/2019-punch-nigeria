Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State said it was unfortunate that the Independent National Electoral Commission went ahead to announce the November 16 governorship election results “in spite of the brigandage and violence that marred the poll.” Dickson stated this during the monthly praise night for November held on Monday in Yenagoa, according to a statement on Tuesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Fidelis Soriwei. The governor insisted that the election was a charade, stressing that voting did not hold in places like Nembe, Ogbia, Southern Ijaw and parts of the Yenagoa local government areas. Dickson, who likened the recent happenings in the state to his political experience in 2012 when he became governor, called on the people to keep faith with God as there would be light at the end of the tunnel. He said, “It is at times like this that children of the most high God should praise and worship even more. Don’t give up because you’re children of the most high.” Copyright PUNCH.
