Raphael Ede, Enugu A six-year-old girl, Kendra Oyibor, who was shot by suspected Fulani herdsmen during an attack on Eke, the hometown of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, and the Director General of the Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, is dead. The PUNCH had reported that the assailants had launched an attack on Eke in the Udi Local Government Area of the state on Sunday evening and injured two persons, the manager of a new generation bank, identified as Maurice Onyibor, and his daughter, Kendra. The man and his daughter were reportedly attacked on the Isigwu Road, Oma-Eke, off the Eke-Egede Road. Maurice was said to be driving to his country home at Oma Eke with his daughter when the gunmen attacked them. The victims were rushed to a hospital, where the girl later died on Tuesday. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Ebere Amaraizu, who confirmed the death of the girl on Thursday, said the command would not leave any stone unturned to unmask those behind the attack. “We received information two days ago that one of the victims of Sunday’s attack had died. It is unfortunate, but what I can assure you and the good people of Enugu State is that those behind the attack will not go unpunished. They will surely be fished out,” Amaraizu said.
