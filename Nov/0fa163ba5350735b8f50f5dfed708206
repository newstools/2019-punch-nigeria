Ademola Babalola, Ibadan The Oyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, has issued a stop work order in respect of the construction of the Ibadan circular road project awarded in May 2017. The governor, who paid a visit to the site of the circular road, off the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, said that the road was meant to connect the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway to the Ibadan-Ife Expressway. He added that work should stop with immediate effect. A statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Taiwo Adisa, quoted Makinde as deploring the discouraging pace of work at the site, during the inspection tour. He said, “Basically, what we saw was not encouraging. The agreement was signed in 2017, almost three years now but the work done so far was at 5 per cent or 5.5 per cent. “Also, this was a concession of about N6.5bn for a 32-kilometre road. We just felt we need to pull back a little bit, look at things holistically and then take a decision in order to move forward.” Copyright PUNCH.
