…Promises to aid relocation of traders Sola Shittu Benin The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has ordered the closure of Santana Market in the Sapele Road axis of Benin City, citing the lack of basic amenities for proper operations of an open market in the vicinity. The governor gave the order during the Weekly State Executive Council meeting, stating that new guidelines for the operations of open markets in the state would soon be made public. Speaking after the exco meeting on Thursday, Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, said the state government closed the market because the location was not suitable for a market of such size.

The state government would offer them N50,000 each while Ikpoba Okha LGA would give them N10,000 each to ease their relocation and help them settle at the markets.” The governor’s aide said some of the reasons for the closure of the market include unavailability of basic amenities such as parking space, functional toilets, potable running water, provisions for relevant facilities to support emergency response, and the spilling of the market to the road, which causes gridlock.
