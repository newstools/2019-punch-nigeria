He gave the warning while delivering the convocation lecture at Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State. The lecture was titled, ‘Some reasons Nigeria has failed to achieve greatness.’ He said, “A good number of people in power today don’t even know the sacrifices we made to get this freedom and democracy. “Creating rules against social media, we should be careful. Freedom is to speak. Freedom is to speak responsibly. “We fought for this freedom and we will defend it with the last drop of our blood. If they think they can take it from us, another one is coming.” [READ ALSO] Police recruitment: Ex-IG Idris submitted N16.8bn budget for recruitment to Abba Kyari – Memo He added, “A nation thrives on free flow of ideas and information.
