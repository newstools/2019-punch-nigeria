Samson Folarin The Accountant-General and Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Treasury Office, Mr Muritala Shefiu, has promised to support accountants in the state public service. He also assured them of justice and fairness in all his dealings. Muritala spoke on Tuesday at the state secretariat, Alausa, when he received the chairman and members of the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria, Ikeja branch, in his office. “As a professional, I will ensure that there is training and retraining of everyone for effective and efficient service delivery in your various ministries, departments and agencies,” he said. The accountant-general, however, charged the association to ensure that its members adhered to the policies of the state government and discharged their duties proactively. He urged them to inform him of any challenge they might be confronting in their various MDAs. Earlier, the Chairman of the group, Mr Bernard Akinnola, said ANAN would support all policies and initiatives of the state government. He, however, asked Muritala to use his good offices to ensure continuous training and retraining of accountants in the MDAs as being enjoyed by other professional bodies in the public service.
