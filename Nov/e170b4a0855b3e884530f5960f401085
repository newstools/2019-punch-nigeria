John Ameh, Abuja The Federal Government is to construct a 600-kilometre gas pipeline from Ajaokuta through Kaduna to Kano, President Muhammadu Buhari has said. The line will transport gas from the southern part of the country to the North. A statement by Presidential spokesperson, Mr Garba Shehu, on Friday said Buhari made the disclosure in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, at the 5th Gas Exporting Countries Forum. He told the summit that in the long run, the line might be further extended to North Africa. Buhari had jetted out of Abuja on Friday for the one-day summit, whose theme was given as ‘Natural Gas – Energy for Sustainable Development’. The President noted that the theme was apt,  adding that the event was“taking place at a critical juncture as global energy supply is transitioning from hydrocarbons to renewables.” The President also said,  “The Paris Accord of 2015 signalled the first major global commitment to a deliberate effort on this inevitable transition.” He added that Nigeria was one of the countries that first appended signatories to the accord.
