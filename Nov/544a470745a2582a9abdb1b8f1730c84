Leke Baiyewu, Abuja The House of Representatives has summoned the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Dr Mohammed Bukar, to explain the status of the ongoing work on the Abuja-Kaduna, Zaria-Kano road projects. Also to appear before the House Committee on Works on Wednesday is the ministry’s Director of Highways Construction and the Construction giant, Julius Berger Plc. The committee, in a statement issued by the Chairman, Kabir Abubakar, in Abuja on Sunday, said Julius Berger was also invited “as a matter of public necessity” to open the completed section of the Abuja-Kaduna expressway to motorists to ease vehicular movement. The committee added that the need for the explanation became necessary due to “barrage of complaints by well-meaning Nigerians travelling on the corridor.” Abubakar called on the construction company working on the road to expedite action on the project to complete it on time.
