Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja An indigenous firm, ENL Consortium Limited, has issued a seven-day ultimatum to Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, to apologise over allegations of misleading and malicious remarks made against the company on the N67bn Ibadan Circular Road Concession Project. The firm said the remarks of the governor that the concession was jerked up from N14bn to N67bn and that N11bn was earmarked for bush clearing were attempts to damage its hard-earned reputation and scare financiers away from the project. Addressing journalists in Abuja, the Chairman of ENL, Prince Clement Haastrup, said the governor’s claims were made “in bad faith and in total falsehood.” The former deputy governor of Osun State said he had been under pressure from family and friends to clear his name so that he would not be derided as one of those that messed up the country. The ENL threatened to drag the state government to the Court of Arbitration in London if the contract was revoked. He said, “This clearly exhibits the malicious intent of the governor’s press release. From our Bills of Quantifies, bush cutting is N750.58m. Haastrup said the firm competitively bid with two other Chinese firms for the contract before it was awarded the concession. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
