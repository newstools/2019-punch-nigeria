South African Airways has cancelled nearly all its domestic and international flights scheduled for Friday and Saturday ahead of a labour strike. The cancellations follow an announcement by the South African Cabin Crew Association and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa that their members will embark on strike from Friday morning, the airline said. The flight cancellations were meant to minimise the impact of disruptions for its customers,’’ the airline said in a statement.
