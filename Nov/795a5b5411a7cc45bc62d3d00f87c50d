Ademola Babalola, Ibadan A 21-year-old apprentice Internet fraudster was, on Monday, sentenced to six months in jail after being found guilty of one count of impersonation filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibadan zonal office. Adeleke Oluwaseyi, who claimed to be in an eight-month online dating apprenticeship when he was arrested in June, operated with the name, Patrick Bob, claiming to be an American. He was sentenced by Justice Joyce Abdulmalik of the Federal High Court, Ibadan Judicial Division. Adeleke was initially arraigned on four counts before the charges were reduced to one after agreeing to a plea bargain pact with the EFCC. The amended charge, to which he pleaded guilty to on Monday, contravened Section 22(3) of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, Etc.) Act, 2015. Owing to his guilty plea, the EFCC counsel, Ifeanyi Agwu, prayed the court to sentence him in accordance with the plea bargain agreement. The convict was also ordered to pay $150 to his victim through the Federal Government of Nigeria as restitution. He will also forfeit his Samsung J3, Infinix and Kigtel phones as well as Lenovo laptop to the Federal Government. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
