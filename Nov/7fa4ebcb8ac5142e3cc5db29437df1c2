Ted Odogwu, Kano The National President, Christian Association of Nigeria, Dr Samson Ayokunle, on Thursday, affirmed that national appointments should not be lopsided. Ayokunle, who spoke during a reception held for him by Joint Baptist Fellowship in Kano, stated that Nigeria could never disintegrate because “God brought Nigeria into existence.” He said, “If you are talking of merit, there is no religion, there is no ethnic groups; where we don’t have people on merit but lopsided along one particular religion or ethnic group, that is inviting trouble.” “Who will disintegrate Nigeria? Rather than Nigeria to disintegrate, it will multiply. The only thing is for Nigerians to plead with the powers that be to recognise the fact that Nigeria is a peculiar country because it is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation.” The clergy noted that anybody who said they were kidnapping for Christ was “totally sick and is one of the agents of Satan.” He added, “Such a person is a specialist in blackmail. Christians have never been faulted in kidnapping in the history of Nigeria. On the Kogi elections, the CAN president said there was nobody he could not pray for. “However, the person that brought such issue out is mischievous because when you are bringing things to the public, you must be sure that you are speaking the truth.
