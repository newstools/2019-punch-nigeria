Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti Ekiti State Commissioner for Information, Muyiwa Olumilua, said on Thursday that registered voters with any other form of biometric based identification should be allowed to vote in the December 7 local government election in the state. Olumilua said, “I believe every Nigerian has a right to vote once you are above the age of 18 and you have your name captured in the voter register. That is constitutional. “It is now left to the presiding officers at the voting points to decide whether to allow that or not.” The commissioner spoke in Ado Ekiti while reacting to allegations by the Peoples Democratic Party that the state government had concluded plans to manipulate the local government election with the decision to allow people vote with driving licence and national identity card. The PDP State Publicity Secretary, Jackson Adebayo, said in a statement that the opposition party would resist the use of any document other than the voter card, saying “it contravenes relevant sections of the constitution and the Electoral Act.” “Government and its agents at the SIEC had resorted to obnoxious steps upon realising that the election would not be a usual game as they had thought at the beginning,” Adebayo said. But Olumilua said, “The constitution allows every Nigerian above the age of 18 to vote. In a case where you have a voter card that is damaged or defaced and what have you, any other form of biometric based identification should be allowed to be used.” Copyright PUNCH.
