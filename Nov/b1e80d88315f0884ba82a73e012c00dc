According to him, the financial sector has a responsibility to the women of Africa. “From now on, we shall be grading every African financial institution on how well it helps women. “Every financial ecosystem must evolve to support women. And we are going to put pressure on the guarantee banks,” Adesina said. Salimata Dieng, the Senegalese Minister of Women, Family and Gender emphasised the need for financial institutions to support initiatives from women. “These women have relatively moderate finance needs, just enough to create projects and jobs. “They need support from the private sector and the banks to help them weave their way into the economy,” she said. Andrew Temu, President of the African Guarantee Fund, advocated holding discussions with countries to improve the business environment. According to Temu, what is especially needed is legislation that reassures the banks. “There are a number of actors, banks, investors, entrepreneurs and clients operating within the economic market. Everyone needs to be in communication to address the risks,” Temu said. Joséphine Anan-Ankomah, the Chief Executive Officer of Ecobank Group said that the bank was already making big strides to gender parity.  (NAN)
