A housewife, Fatima Ishaq, on Wednesday sued her husband, Hassan Haruna, before a Sharia Court in Kaduna after the man was accused of raping an underage child. The petitioner who lives with her estranged husband within Kaduna metropolis, through her counsel, M.S. Abdullahi, told the court that she cannot continue to live with Haruna. Abdullahi said his client can no longer guarantee her respect for Haruna. He told the court that his client was willing to refund the N5,000 her husband paid as bride price in 2006. The petitioner is also seeking custody of their four children and N20,000 monthly for their upkeep.

Haruna, however, denied the charge of rape against him. “If it is because of the rape issue you want to leave me, I can swear with the Holy Quran that I am innocent; even though I will oblige your divorce request,” he said. The judge, Dahiru Lawal, terminated the marriage and ordered the petitioner to return N15,000 to Haruna, saying, “The value of money in 2006 is not the same in the current situation.”  (NAN)
