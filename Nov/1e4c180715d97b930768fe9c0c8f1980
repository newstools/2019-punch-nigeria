John Charles Makurdi Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State on Tuesday advanced reason for accepting the Federal Government’s National Livestock Transformation Plan in the state. Ortom, who spoke during the launch of the NLTP in Makurdi, said the state accepted the programme when stakeholders were convinced that the state would be free to own and implement it. The governor however expressed optimism  that the programme would adhere strictly to the state’s Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, 2017. He assured the people of the state that  the Plan would be implemented according to peculiarities of Benue State, stressing that focus would be on livestock such as pigs, goats, poultry, sheep and cows.
