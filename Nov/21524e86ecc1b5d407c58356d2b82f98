He said, “On the part of customers, there is need for them to review their accounts periodically with a view to ensuring they are being managed in accordance with the rules/regulations of the noble banking profession.” Ogubunka urged those who may not, for various reasons, be disposed to doing this important periodic review to consider obtaining the services of professionals for assistance.
