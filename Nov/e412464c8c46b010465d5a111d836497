Matthew Ochei, Asaba The Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, has charged the state’s Board of Internal Revenue not to relying solely on Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) for tax revenue, charging them to carry out reforms that would enhance revenue generation in the state. He challenged the board to ensure that all those who were supposed to be in the tax net were captured. The governor who gave the charge on Friday in Asaba while inaugurating a member of the Revenue Board said that there were lots of businesses in the state that were doing well which the revenue board should include in its tax net instead of relying solely on PAYE for revenue. He said that funds were needed by the government to execute its mandate to the people, but decried the inability of the state to meet its internal revenue generation target.
